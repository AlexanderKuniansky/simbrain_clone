#summary Evaluating a Dataset Using PCA

Here is the basic process:

  * Open Simbrain
  * Insert a dataworld
  * Import your data as csv
  * Set dataworld to iterate
  * Insert a projection component
  * Couple the dataworld component to projection
  * Do a run through the data by pressing global run
  * The resulting set of points in the projection graph represent a projection of your data
