These directories contain sample programs written using one or more of the jar files associted with Simbrain.  They illustrate how to use Simbrain as a library in your applications.  They can also be used do some useful things for regular Simbrain simulations, like evolve specialized neural networks.

Each folder should contain a README which explains what you need to do to compile and run the example(s) in that directory.

Sample Simbrain workspace and xml files associated with the Simbrain application itself are not helpd here.  For example, scripts are in the ../scripts directory.

I (Jeff Yoshimi)  have not yet decided how these examples will be distributed and am open to suggestions.
