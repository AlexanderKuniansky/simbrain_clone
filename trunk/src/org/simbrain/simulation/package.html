The <b>simulation</b> package contains the top level container for the other components of Simbrain--the network, world, and gauge(s).  Global key events are handled here.  Simulation is currently visible as the menu-bar above the network panel.  Neural network menu commands are forwarded to the neural network component.  Plans are to make the simulation component a free-floating set of buttons, from which arbitrarily many networks, environments, and gauges can be created and linked.
