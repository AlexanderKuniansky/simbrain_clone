The <b>simnet.attributes</b> package contains classes which wrap neural network objects and provide
them with attributes (see org.simbrain.workspace).   For example, as neurons are created in a neural network,
neuronwrapper objects, with activation, upperbound, and other attributes, are created.  This keeps attributes
cleanly separated from the objects they apply to.
