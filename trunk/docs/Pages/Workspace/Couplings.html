  </p><h1>Couplings</h1><br>
<p>An individual coupling represents a one way informational link between two attributes in Simbrain. These links can occur between attributes of different components or even within the same component. In this way information can be made to flow from one component to another. When using the couplings manager, the attribute which sends information to another attribute is known as a <b><i>producer</i></b>, and the attribute receiving that information is known as a <b><i>consumer</i></b> (see <b>Coupling Creation</b> below).</p>

<p>A list of all current couplings can be found in the Coupligns tab of the bottom information pane or within the coupling manager.</p>

<p>Most windows in Simbrain (i.e. workspace components) are
wrappers around other objects designed to exist in the
workspace. These nested objects are known as attributes and can (for instance) include such values as the activation of a given neuron in the workspace, or a value of a line on a time-series (see <b>Attributes</b> below). &nbsp; Attributes can be thought of as the "hooks" or "anchor points" that make up couplings, and couplings represent the uni-directional data flow between these hooks. In this sense where the information is coming from and where it is being sent to must be specified and the workspace can be thought of as a collection of components which send and receive information (producers and consumers respectively). Making a simulation amounts to making components which send and recieve information, and coupling these components represents the way in which this information transfer is carried out.&nbsp; For example, a simulation might involve coupling neurons whose neurons are producers to a bar chart whose bars are consumers (to see this, try bar chart test in the script menu).</p>

<p>More specifically, an attribute is generic term for a any part of a component which has a value that may be sent to or recieved from another component, i.e. something that produces values or consumes values.</p>
<p>Examples are neuron activations, weight strengths, or bars on a bar chart, or sensor values for an agent in a virtual world.</p>
<p>They are the parts of a coupling, attachments points in the
simulation environment that can be connected together in the broader
simulation.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="heading">Coupling Creation</span><br>
</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to create couplings.<br>
</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Use the coupling manager. To open this press the coupling manager
button on the Simbrain toolbar. This allows you to view every coupling
in the workspace. 
The current design is based on a mode where each component can be selected as either a 
consumer or producer of data. Having done just that in the example below, notice that
selecting a given component causes its attributes which are suitable for coupling to appear in 
the producer and consumer boxes. Below is a screenshot of the coupling manager. In this example, the activation of neuron 102 in network 1 will be sent to a time series plot, where it will be plotted as time series </p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Currently each attribute carries with it a specific data type (in this case <b>double</b>). Couplings can only occur between attributes which share the same data type.</p>

<p><br><b>2.</b> &nbsp;Via context menus inside specific components (see below). &nbsp;E.g. if
you right click on a neuron in a neural network a context menu will
point you to all other potential consuming and producing attributes in
the whole workspace. &nbsp;These context menus are built at the
workspace menu by polling all current workspace components.<br>
</p>

<br>

<p><br><b>3.</b> Via "coupling" commands in some menus. &nbsp;Quick and easy!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<br>

<p><b>4.</b> Using a beanshell script one can directly code couplings. While efficient for more advanced users, scripts are generally speaking not a part of the simbrain GUI (with perhaps exception to their selection from a menu or any GUIs they might spawn). See the <a href="../Scripting.html">Scripting</a> page for more information.<br>
