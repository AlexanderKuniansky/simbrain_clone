The network     component in turn can produce outputs which are received by the world component    and affect how the creature moves. The world component can also be seen    as a user-friendly way to control the inputs and observe the outputs of a    complex neural net in the network component of Simbrain.    </FONT></P><P align="center"><IMG SRC="../Pics/World.gif" WIDTH="363" HEIGHT="365"></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   The world component has its own window  that displays a rectangular region        within which the creature can move about. The window contains icons which       show  the position of the creature and various objects. There is one and       only one  creature in the world but users can add and delete objects.       The creature and  each object have properties which can be set by theuser in the <a href="#DialogWorld">world dialog box</a> and  <a href="#DialogEntity">entitydialog box</a>.</FONT></P><P>For more relevant information see the section on <a href="Network.html#net_world_interaction">network-worldinteraction</a> in the network documentation.</P><P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="motor_commands" id="motor_commands"></a>Motor commands </FONT></P><p>The creature in the world can be moved by the network. Each time the network  is updated (e.g. when the network is run using the <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> button),  the commands associated with those output nodes whose activity is above zero  are issued.  Thus, if a network has an <a href="Network.html#input_output">output  node</a> associated with the motor  command &quot;North&quot;, then as long as that node is active above zero the creaturewill move north. </p><p>The creature in Simbrain doesn't do anything very interesting right now,  mainly because the world component has been used thus far to study perception,  not sensorimotor integration or control. Improvements to the motor dimension  of Simbrain are coming, though not for several releases, so please contact  the developers if you are interested in working in this area. </p><P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="sensory_stim" id="sensory_stim"></a>Sensorystimulation overview </FONT></P><P>In general, sensory stimulation is modeled in Simbrain by simulating the impact  an environment will have on the creature's sensory receptors. In particular,  the world component constructs a <em></em><strong><em>proximal  stimulus</em>,</strong> <em><strong>receptor  vector</strong>,</em> or <em><strong>input vector</strong></em> (all  three phrases are synonymous in Simbrain) based on a number of factors, including  the relative position of the creature and the objects and the values associated  with the different objects. Each object in the world component is associated  with an <em><strong>object  vector</strong></em>, or <em><strong>distal stimulus</strong></em> value.  Roughly speaking (details below), the world creates a proximal stimulus  from a set of distal stimuli.The input vector that is thereby created is a  vector of values which are sent to the neural network's <a href="Network.html#input_output">input      nodes</a>,      each of which is associated with some component of this vector via a <em><strong>sensory      index</strong> </em>.      The world component thereby produces patterns of activity across the sensory      &quot;receptors&quot; of the creature's neural network. For example, if      the world produces an input vector of the following form,</P><P align="center"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">5, 0, 1, 1, 5</font></P><P>then an input node with sensory index 1 will receive the value 5, an input  node with sensory index 2 will receive the value 0, etc.</P><P><FONT SIZE="3">The icon for the creature is the white mouse (note that even though there         is  only one type of icon for the creature other types organisms can be         modeled in  Simbrain--not just white mice). There are currently six different         icons for  representing the objects that can exist in the world--blue         cheese, gouda,  swiss, decaying fish, flower blossoms, and pink flower         blossoms. These icons  are merely symbols and don't necessarily indicate         the properties the user  selects for the objects. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   The icons for the creature and the objects have been chosen to suggest the       sense modality of smell. In the real world the sense of smell is the sense       of particular chemicals which make their way into an animal's nose. Chemicals       are released into the air by various objects and once a chemical is airborne       it tends to diffuse away from the object producing it. The further away       from an object an animal is the harder it is for the animal to smell the       object. Some animals have a much better sense of smell than others and       some objects produce a stronger odor than others. The question of whether       an animal will smell an object depends on how sensitive the animal's sense       of smell is, how much of an odor the object is producing, and how far       apart the animal and object are.  </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   The world component includes a representation of the different factors thatare involved in sensory processes. The settings that the user selects in theentity dialog box control both the proximal stimulation (the stimulationexperienced by the creature) and the distal stimulation (the stimulus producedby the object). Once the user has selected the properties they would like thecreature and the objects to have the inputs that are sent to the network component are determined by the position of the creature in relation to the objects.  Generally the further apart the creature and an object are from each        other the smaller the input generated by the world component is. Simbrain       is  constructed so that other kinds of virtual worlds (involving sight,       sound, and  multi-modal sensory combinations) can easily be added. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">   <a name="manually_moving"></a>Manually moving the creature &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../Pics/Mouse.gif"></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   There are two ways users can manually move the creature (as opposed to lettingthe activity of the network's output nodes move it via <a href="#motor_commands">motorcommands</a>). </FONT></P><blockquote>  <p><FONT SIZE="3">1. <em><strong>Drag      the creature's icon</strong></em>.

In each case the larger the value of Dispersion the more slowly   the stimulus intensity decreases with distance. For more detailed information   on the meaning of the dispersion value for a particular decay function see   the description of the decay function.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   <em><strong>Decay: </strong></em>The Decay function controls how the intensity   of the stimulus from the  object decreases with distance. Currently there   are four types of decay function: step, linear, Gausian, and Quadratic.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3"> <UL><LI>      <B> Step </B> The simplest decay function is the step function where the      stimulus has a constant value within a given radius and is zero outside      this radius. This radius is set in the dispersion row of the entity dialog     box.</LI><LI>      <B> Linear </B> The linear decay function causes the stimulus intensity to      decrease linearly with distance until it reaches zero.  Beyond that      distance the intensity remains zero.  The descent slope of the linear      decay function is set in the dispersion row of the Entity dialog box.</LI><LI>      <B> Gaussian </B> The Gaussian decay function causes the stimulus      intensity to decrease according to the Gaussian function (a bell shaped      surface).  This is a good representation of how substances diffuse through      fluids like air and water.  The standard deviation of the Gaussian is set     in the dispersion row of the Entity dialog box.</LI><LI>      <B> Quadratic </B> The quadratic decay function actually causes the      stimulus intensity to decrease according to the inverse square law <EM>      i.e. </EM> as the reciprocal of the square of the distance.   This is a      good representation for how the intensity of light and sound deceases with     distance.  The rate of decay is set in the dispersion row of the Entity      dialog box.</LI></UL> </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">    <em><strong>Add noise: </strong></em>The "Add Noise" option allows users to   add noise to the sensory inputs produced by objects in the World component.   The perception of the real world by living organisms often involves some element   of randomness or noise. This noise can come from the environment or it can   be intrinsic to the sense organs themselves. When the "Add Noise" option is   selected each stimulus value of the object has a small random number generated   for it. The random numbers are added to the stimulus values which are then   sent to the input nodes of the Network component. Note that the value of each   input node is restricted to lie between a preset minimum and maximum value.   Stimulus values which are out of bounds for the input node are clipped to   the nearest boundary value. The value of the input node can also be rounded   off.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">   The random numbers that are generated for the stimulus values follow a Gaussian probability distribution function.  The Noise level slider allows the        user to control the value of the standard deviation for the Gaussian        distribution. The numbers along the slider stand for percents and the        value of "Noise level" ranges from 0% to 100%.  The standard deviation        is set equal to the chosen percentage of the maximum stimulus value.        When the value of Noise level is 0% no noise is added. When the value        of Noise level is 100% the amount of noise which is added at each iteration        is on the same scale as  the largest stimulus value. Values of Noise        level in between 0% and 100% provide intermediate amounts of noise to        the stimulus values.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">  <em><strong>Stimulus values: </strong></em>Each object currently has a &quot;distal  stimulus vector&quot; associated to it. This vector currently has eight components  or &quot;stimulus values.&quot; In future releases it will be possible to specify  arbitrarily many stimulus values for each object. The distal stimulus vector  can be thought of as a profile of the effect an object will have on the creature's  receptors if it is near it. The distal stimulus vectors of all the objects  are transformed on the basis of distance between them and the creature and  the presence of noise. These transformed stimulus vectors are then combined  to create the input vector that will be sent to the neural network.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="DialogWorld" id="DialogWorld"></a>World Dialog Box </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="3">    The World dialog box allows the user control some general properties ofthe World component.
