<p>The creature in the world can be moved by the network. Each time the network is updated (e.g. when the network is run using the <img src="../../../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> button), the commands associated with those output nodes whose activity is above zero are issued. Thus, if a network has an <a href="../../Network/prefs/inoutnodes.html">output node</a> associated with the motor command &quot;North&quot;, then as long as that node is active above zero the creature will move north. </p>
<p>The creature in Simbrain doesn't do anything very interesting right now, mainly because the world component has been used thus far to study perception, not sensorimotor integration or control. Improvements to the motor dimension of Simbrain are coming, though not for several releases, so please contact the developers if you are interested in working in this area. </p>
