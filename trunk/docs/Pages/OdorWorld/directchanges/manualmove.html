<p><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Manually moving the creature &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../../../Pics/Mouse.gif"> </FONT></p>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"> There are three ways users can manually move the creature (as opposed to letting the activity of the network's output nodes move it via <a href="../neuralinteraction/motorcommands.html">motor commands</a>). </FONT></P>
<blockquote>
  <p><FONT SIZE="3">1. <em><strong>Drag the creature's icon</strong></em>. This is done by placing the cursor over the creature's icon, holding down the left mouse button, and sliding the computer mouse. The creature's icon will move with the cursor until you let up on the left mouse button. The sensory inputs to the network component can either be updated as the creature is dragged or only when the user lets up on the left mouse button. This option is set in the <a href="../menus/worlddialog.html">world dialog box.</a> Note that while you can move the creature's icon outside of the world component's window if you let up on the left mouse button while the creature is outside of the window you may no longer be able to move the creature (if you move the creature beyond the right or bottom edges you may be able find the creature by enlarging the window). </FONT></p>
  <p><FONT SIZE="3">2. <em><strong>Making the creature &quot;follow&quot; left clicks</strong></em>. Click on a creature using the computer mouse, point the cursor at some spot in the world component's window and left click on that spot. The creature will move slightly in the direction of the spot the cursor is pointing at. (Note: This method for moving the creature can be turned off or on in the <a href="../menus/worlddialog.html">world dialog box</a>, as well as the distance the creature moves with each computer mouse click.)</FONT></p>
  <p>3. <em><strong>Using arrow keys.</strong></em> Using the computer mouse, click on the creature you wish to move. The creature that was click on can now be moved forward, reverse, left and right by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. The up arrow will move the creature forward, the down arrow will move the creature backward, and the left or right arrows will turn the creature the corresponding left or right directions. Each time an arrow key is pressed, the attached network, if any, is updated and the creature will move slightly in the direction pressed. (Note: Moving any creature in this fashion may result in unexpected behavior if the creature's movement is attached to a network output.)</p>
