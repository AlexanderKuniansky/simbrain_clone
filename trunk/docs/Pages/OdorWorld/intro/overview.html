<P><FONT SIZE="3">The world component illustrates how neural nets can model the interaction of living organisms with their environment in the real world. We think of the creature in the world component as having the ability to move about in its world and to sense other objects which exist in that world. The sensory inputs produced by the world component are received by the network component which we can think of as a part of the creature's information processing system <EM> e.g. </EM> an ensemble of neurons in an animal's nervous system. The network component in turn can produce outputs which are received by the world component and affect how the creature moves. The world component can also be seen as a user-friendly way to control the inputs and observe the outputs of a complex neural net in the network component of Simbrain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="3"> The world component has its own window that displays a rectangular region within which the creature can move about. The window contains icons which show the position of the creature and various objects. There is one and only one creature in the world but users can add and delete objects. The creature and each object have properties which can be set by the user in the <a href="../menus/worlddialog.html">world dialog box</a> and <a href="../menus/entitydialog.html">entity dialog box</a>.</FONT></P>
