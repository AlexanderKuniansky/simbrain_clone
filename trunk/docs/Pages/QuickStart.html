<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quick Start </font></p>
<p><em><strong>Run a simulation</strong></em>. When Simbrain launches, simply
  press play <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> in the network
toolbar and observe activity propagating through the network and the creature
  moving. Open different simulations and
  press play in each case to see what happens. Some good simulations to play
with are <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">behavior.sim</font> and <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cage.sim</font>.
As a simulation runs, try selecting and deleting neurons to see what impact
this has on the creature's behavior. </p>
<p><em><strong>Manually
  moving the creature around</strong>. </em>Try
  clicking play, <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18">,
  and moving the creature <img src="../Pics/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> around
 different objects. This is like picking up the creature and
  placing it in different places. Try this (1) with the <a href="Network/prefs/networldbutton.html">interaction
  button</a> set
  to &quot;both ways&quot; <img src="../Pics/BothWays.gif" width="18" height="18"> and,
  (2) with it set to &quot;world to
  net&quot; only <img src="../Pics/WorldToNet.gif" width="18" height="18">. In
  the first case you are testing sensormotor coordination; in the second case
  you are only testing the way the network reacts to stimuli. Try the simulation <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">wta_generalization.sim</font>,
    and note that the creature responds similarly to different flowers even though
  they stimulate it slightly differently.</p>
<p><em><strong>Studying a network on its own. </strong></em>(Set <a href="Network/prefs/networldbutton.html">network-world
    interaction</a> to <img src="../Pics/NeitherWay.gif" width="18" height="18"> )
    Open a network, for example one of the ring networks, and press the step
    button <img src="../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> (or
      the space bar) to see how it works. Open other networks, lasso nodes, and <a href="Network/commands/manualadjust.html">manually
      adjust</a> activation
      with the up an down arrow
            buttons.
    Then press the step button or space bar to see what happens to the activation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Finding stable states.</em></strong> (Set <a href="Network/prefs/networldbutton.html">network-world
    interaction</a> to <img src="../Pics/NeitherWay.gif" width="18" height="18"> )
    While in the network component, select all nodes with &quot;N&quot;,  press &quot;R&quot; to
    randomize the nodes and press the space bar a few times to update the network
    until it settles into a stable state (that is, until the nodes don't change
    when you press space). Repeat; press &quot;R&quot; and &quot;space,
  space,space&quot; repeatedly
  until the net settles in a stable state, then &quot;R&quot; and &quot;space,
  space, space.&quot; again,
etc. In this way get a sense of the stable states of that network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Build or edit a network. </strong></em>Clear the screen by selecting
  &quot;New network&quot; from the Network menu and create a few neurons using the <img src="../Pics/New.gif" width="18" height="18"> button.
  Then connect them as
  described <a href="Network/editing/buildingnets.html">here</a>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Study network parameters.</strong> </em>Select all nodes with &quot;N&quot;,
  then double-click on a node. Change it's decay value, activation function,
  etc. Then move the creature around a bit (by left dragging) to see how network
  dynamics have changed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Study learning.</strong> </em>Select all weights with &quot;W&quot;, then double-click
  on a weight. Change it's learning rule or other parameters. Then move the creature
  around a bit to see how learning
(change of weights over time) is affected.</p>
<p><em><strong>Use Gauges.</strong> </em>Open a gauge by pressing the add
  gauge <img src="../Pics/Gauge.gif" width="18" height="18"> button and
  open the simulation <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">simple.sim</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">loops.sim</font>.
  Drag the creature around the different objects and watch the patterns that
  emerge in the gauge. Try opening different worlds and gauges and seeing what
  patterns show up in the gauge. When a pattern has developed for a period of
  time, switch the gauge projection chooser from &quot;coordinate&quot; to &quot;PCA&quot; and
  from &quot;PCA&quot; to &quot;Sammon.&quot; When
  it is in Sammon press the <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> play
button inside that gauge to see what patterns emerge. </p>
