It contains components which are coupled to one another, and tools for managing these interactions.</P> <P>In the GUI, the workspace is visible as the Simbrain desktop. </P> <P>The overall design is (1) a list of components, (2) a list of couplings and a coupling manager for managing interactions between componetns, (3) an updator for managing simulation update. </P> <P>Most windows in Simbrain and workspace components, which are wrappers around other objects, which are designed to exist in a workspace. For you the user, this mainly means attributes (for couplings). Couplings tie these objects together via attributes. Attributes are the &quot;hooks&quot; or &quot;anchor points&quot; that make up couplings. There are two kinds, producing and consuming, which spit out and gobble up numbers (currently; may be abstracted to more general datatypes)</P> <P>The workspace can be thought of as a bunch of things that spit out numbers and read them in. Making a simulation amounts to making number spitter-outers and number-readers. </P> <P>For example, a simulation might involve coupling neurons whose neurons are producers to a bar chart whose bars are consumers (to see this, try bar chart test in the script menu). </P> <P><img src="../Images/WorkspaceLarge.png" width="600" height="370"></P> <p class="heading">Building a Simulation </p> <blockquote>    <p>The main things you need to do to make a simulation are: </p>    <p><strong>1) Add components</strong><br>      - Use the buttons<br>      - Add from a script</p>    <p><strong>2) Connect together components</strong><br>      - Use the coupling manager<br>      - Use the menus (single or group)<br>      - Make them in a program script (and then, for GUI, save)</p>    <p><strong>3) Run the simulation</strong><br>      - Use the built in method (buffering based)<br>      - Create your own update method</p>  </blockquote> <p class="heading">Desktop Interface Components </p> <blockquote>    <p><strong>Bottom Tabs</strong>: provide information on the state of the workspace.</p>    <blockquote>      <p>Components: list components and allows you to turn them on and off <br>        Couplings: list current couplings<br>        Terminal: interact with workspace directly using beanshell commands (essentially realtime java) <br>       Updator: status of simbrain updator </p>    </blockquote>    <p><strong>Toolbar</strong></p>    <p><strong>Menus</strong></p>    <p><strong>Key Commands </strong></p>  </blockquote> <p class="heading">Other Topics </p> <blockquote>   <p><strong>Scripts</strong>: see the readme in the /scripts directory </p> </blockquote> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp; </P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>&nbsp;</P></div></body></html>
