        <p> <a href="menus.html">Menu commands</a> in the <em>menu bar</em> are described below.</p>
        <p>The <em>tool bar</em> buttons are the ones you will be most likely to use in practice as you explore a dataset. If you are new to HiSee try changing the projection algorithm using the main drop-down list, and, while in "Sammon," try pressing play and "randomize" repeatedly to get a sense of how the algorithm works. For details on each projection method click <a href="projmeth.html">here</a>; for details on the toolbar, including how to link different projections, click <a href="toolbars.html">here</a>. Note that when HiSee is incorporated into another program a <a href="compmode.html">Component mode</a> indicator appears on the left side of the Tool bar (not shown above). This allows the user to monitor and control the flow of data into HiSee.</p>
        <p>The <em>status bar</em> shows the number of points in the data set for the high dimensional object and the number of dimensions of the space containing the high dimensional object. In the illustration there are 819 data points in the high dimensional data set and the high dimensional space has 3 dimensions. The Status bar can be turned off in the Graphics preferences menu. Other information, in particular an error-rate for the Sammon map, can also be shown here. See the <a href="pref.html">Preferences section</a> below. </p>
        <p>The <em>display</em> contains the image of the projected object. The user can pan and zoom this image by dragging the mouse while holding the left and right buttons down, respectively (see the <a href="display.html">Display section</a> below) and, by clicking on individual points, can see what they correspond to in the high dimensional dataset. </p></td>
