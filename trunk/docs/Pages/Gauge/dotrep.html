<p>Each dot represents a state of the network. When a gauge is first opened, there are no dots, since no state information has been sent to the gauge yet. With each update of the network, state information is sent to that gauge which displays it as a dot. The set of dots that appear in the gauge window represent the set of states that have been visited since that gauge was added. This gives us a kind of visual history of this network's past behavior. As the network is updated the user can watch new dots appear as new states arise. </p>
<p><span class="heading">Colors</span> </p>
<p>There are two colors of dots in the network, the color of the &quot;hot point&quot; and the other dots. This color can be set in the <a href="preferences.html">preference dialog.</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Hot Point</span>: The current state of the network.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Other Points:</span> Past states of the network. </p>
