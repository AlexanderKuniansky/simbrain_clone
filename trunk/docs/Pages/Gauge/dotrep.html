<p>When a gauge is first opened, there are no dots, since no state information has been sent to the gauge yet. With each update of the network, state information is sent to that gauge which displays it as a dot. The latest state is represented (by default) with a <strong><em>red dot</em></strong>, and past states are represented (by default) with <strong><em>green dots</em></strong>. Thus, the set of dots that appear in the gauge window represent the set of states that have been visited (in the subspace that gauge is associated with) since that gauge was added. This gives us a kind of visual history of this network's past behavior. As the network is updated (e.g., as the creature in the world is moved), the user can watch new dots appear as new states arise. The user can also observe which previous states are visited by watching which green dots turn red. </p>
