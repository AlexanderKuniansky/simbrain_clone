        <h1>Reader World</h1>
        <p>Reader world intuitively models "reading" by converting text to numbers and vectors of numbers. The most common use would be to set up a reader to produce inputs to a neural network. </p>

        <p> Text in the main display is parsed by letter or word (where a "word" is the determined by a regular expression that can be customized), and highlighted. This item is converted in to scalar or vector values and sent to consumers (mainly neurons and neuron groups) via couplings. When the reader world is updated, the current character or word is highlighted. A dictionary is consulted, and if a match is found, any correspond couplings produce values:
            <ul>
                <li>Scalar: When the character or word is highlighted, send a value of 1 to all associated consumers. Stored in the "token dictionary"</li>
                <li>Vector: When the character or word is highlighted, send a vector to all associated consumers. These vectors are specified in the "vector dictionary".
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--      <p>These convert text to numbers and vectors of numbers. They can be used to model reading. The most common use would be to set up a reader world to produce inputs to a neural network.</p>
        <p>The basic way reader worlds work is that you load some text of interest in to the main window (just copy and paste in).&nbsp; Then, at each iteration of the workspace, the current token (either a word or a character) is highlighted, and is converted in to single number (scalar) or vector of numbers and sent to another component via couplings. </p>

        <p>Attribute types are set in the <a href="../../Workspace/Couplings.html#CouplingManager">coupling manager.</a> Reader world attributes are producers, since text is parsed and then used to produce numerical values.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <span class="heading2">Letter-based:</span> These are scalar couplings where when a given letter is activated, a value of 1 is sent to the target consumer. The decimeter type should be set to <span style="font-style: italic;">character. </span>For example in a network you could right click on a node, go to "receive scalar coupling from" and then in the context menu choose "ReaderWorld1" and then "a" to make that neuron respond to the letter a being parsed. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <span class="heading2">Token-vector:</span> These are vectors couplings where when a given word or token is activated, the vector-dictionary is consulted, and a corresponding vector is sent to the target consumer (or a zero-vector if no match is found). The target will typically be a <a href="../../Network/groups/NeuronGroup.html">neuron group</a>. The delimiter type should be set to
            <span style="font-style: italic;">word.
            </span>The vector dictionary can be edited using the vector-dictionary editor, which stores a list of tokens and corresponding vectors, which can be of variable length.

        <p> <span class="heading">Example</span>
            <p>Load the reader with a selection of text to be parsed and converted into patterns. Just copy and paste in to the central text area. In letter mode, as the world is updated, the cursor advances one character at a time. It goes back to the beginning of the text when it reaches the end.<br>
                <br>In letter mode, creates a set of producers. One producer for each letter. A coupling can be created between a letter-producer and a consumer (e.g. a neuron). One update each, if the letter-producer corresponding to the current letter sends a value of 1 to the corresponding consumer. In this way a passage of text can be converted in to a series of neural activations. </p>
            <p><span class="heading2">Sample Project:</span> Couple a reader world in letter mode to a network of 26 neurons. Run and watch how this works. Then connect this activation to other networks.</p>
