        <h1>Text World</h1>
        <!--  <p>There are two kinds of text worlds, display world and reader world. These worlds can be used to model language, for example, to make networks that respond to sentences or that "talk". With text worlds, the way you set up couplings (see <a href="../../Workspace/Couplings.html">couplings</a>) is especially important, so a review of that could help.</p> -->

        <p>A text world translates between text and neural activity. It can be used to model reading, dyslexia, dialogue, etc. There are two kinds of text world, reader world and display world. With text worlds, the way you set up couplings (see <a href="../../Workspace/Couplings.html">couplings</a>) is especially important, so a review of that could help. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p> <span class="heading2">Reader world:</span> Convert text to patterns of activity. Cf. Wernicke&#39;s area, which is involved in understanding speech and writing. Can be used to model reading words, hearing phonemes, etc.</p>
            <p><span class="heading2">Display world:</span> Convert patterns of activity to text. Cf. Broca&#39;s area, which is involves in producing speech and writing. Can be used to model "speaking."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Note that actual models of reading or hearing tend to use graphemes or phonemes, and can get pretty complicated, whereas with computers, coding schemes are used. Coding schemes, also called localist vs. disturbed, are ways by mean to help translate computer language to human language. Localist is one neuron goes to one word or letter. Distributed is a pattern of activations goes to a word. In the reverse directions a single letter or word can produce activation in a single neuron, or can produce a distributed pattern of activaiton over a set of neurons.</p>

        <p>Elman's work can be modeled using text worlds. See the scripts in the script menu that have start with
            <q>elman</q>. </p>

        <p>Seidenberg's work is another example of work that could eventually be modelled with text worlds. From Seidenberg, <em>Computational Models of Reading: Connectionist and Dual-Route Approaches</em>,
            <q>All the models have been concerned with processes involved in reading words, but they have emphasized different aspects of this skill: acquisition; skilled performance; developmental impairments (dyslexia); impairments following brain injury (acquired dyslexia); computation of pronunciations; computation of meanings; naming, lexical decision, and other tasks; bases of individual differences; and others.</q>
        </p>
        <p><b>Sample Project.</b> Failing (for now) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>. Create a model of dialog. You should be able to enter a line of text in a reader world. Iterate the workspace until the end of the line. Observe a network
            <q>respond</q> to this line of text via a display world. Try to tune the network to produce reasonable amounts of words in response to a sentence.</p>
