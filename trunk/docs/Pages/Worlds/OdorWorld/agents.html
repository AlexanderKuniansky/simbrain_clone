  <h1>Agents </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><center><em>Agents have all the abilities that <a href="objects.html">objects</a> have, and more.</em></center></p>
  <p><img src="../../../Images/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> The Agent is a creature of the Odor World that can be manipulated by a neural network. The neural network can be thought of as the brain of the agent; without a network controlling the agent, it does nothing. For a network to control an agent, it must be <a href="../../Network/couplings.html">coupled</a> with an agent by an Output Command. When dealing with an Odor World, Output Commands are pretty much the motor controls of an agent, like moving forward or backward, and turning left or right. Networks can also be coupled to agents by Input Sensors. An agent's Input Sensors can be modeled to symbolize any form of sense, let it be audition, sight, olfaction, temperature, or touch. Input Senses are broken down into three fields of sensing: the <em>Left</em> whisker, the <em>Right</em> whisker, and the <em>Center</em> nose. Each of these sensors can be sensititive to one of the stimulus values. agents can "smell" other agents, but not themselves. 
  <p class="heading">Output Commands</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p> Output Commands are essentially the motor controls of the agent. When coupling a neuron to an agent, one can choose between two styles of movement: relative movement, and absolute movement. Relative movements are motor commands that tell the agent to move based on a relative perspective, such as to move <em>forward</em> or to the <em>right</em>. Absolute movements tell the agent to move in directs that are independent of its direction and position, such as move to the <em>north</em> or to the <em>south-west</em>. All movements are scaled based on the activity of the coupled neuron; the larger the activation, the faster the agent. If a neuron is coupled with an agent and its activation becomes negative, the neuron will command the agent to do the opposite of what it would normally do. This is such that when a neuron that normally turns the agent <em>right</em> becomes negative, it will instead start telling the agent to turn left.
  <p><span class="heading">Coupling of Output Commands</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before selecting an Output Command, one must first select the agent. If there are multiple agents, one must differentiate between agents by their name, which can 	be changed in the dialogue of that particular agent. Once an agent as been highlighted, another popup menu will appear with the following Output Commands:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">North, South, East, West, North-east, North-west, South-east, South-west.</span> These move the creature in absolute directions. </p>
      <p><span class="heading2">Left, Right, Forward, Backward.</span>. These move the creature relative to its orientation. These are particularly useful for programming                                                           		AI.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <p class="heading">Input Sensors</p>
  <blockquote><p>Input Sensors receive information from Odor World, and in particular, agents. Input Sensors for agents follow the theme as their default agent image, the mouse. The mouse has a left whisker, a central nose, and a right whisker, each of which can be sensed independently. In the Odor World, each of these sensors can detect parts of a broadcasted Stimulus pattern, and depending on how well the signal is picked up, the neuron to which the signal detection is coupled will be come active. 
  </p>
 <p><center><img src="../../../Images/Agent-Sensors.gif"></center></p>
  <p>The <em>Center</em> Input Sensor follows straight from the center of the agent's perspective, along the nose. The whiskers then shoot off symmetrically from this center of perspective at an angle determined by the parameter <em>Whisker Angle</em>, denoted above by &theta;, which is in degrees. The length of the whiskers can be set by changing the Whisker Length parameter, in pixels. These parameters are set in the <a href="entitydialog.html#Agent">Entity Dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>In the Odor World, there is a variable amount of Stimulus Dimensions, set by default to be 8. All agents and objects broadcast customizable stimulus patterns during each iteration. An agent can pick up on these broadcasted signals, using its nose or whiskers, when a neuron is coupled with the agent to receive that input. A sensor can only receive only one dimension of the stimulus pattern at a time, using only one method at a time; this is to say, when coupling a neuron to an agent, a whisker/nose must be specified, and a stimulus dimension must be specified. </p>
  <p><span class="heading">Coupling of Input Sensors</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If one were to couple a neuron to an agent as an Input Sensor, one would first right-click on the neuron, highlight <em>Input Sensor</em>, highlight the agent for the neuron to be coupled with, then select either:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
	  <p><span class="heading2">Left, Right, or Center.</span> Where <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> denote the left and right whisker, and <em>Center</em> denotes the central nose. 
      </blockquote>
	<p>Then, one would select which stimulus dimension the sensor should receive.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p><span class="heading2">1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n-th stimulus dimension.</span> Where the number refers to the stimulii's stimulus dimension index. Each dimension can be thought of as a unique signal; where one signal may symbolize priority in flavor, another might symbolize priority in aesthetics. <em>The meaning of each signal is entirely dependent on how the network is designed to interpret that signal.</em>
	</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Moving of Agents</p>
	<blockquote>
  <p>Agents can be either be dragged using the mouse, or controlled using keyboard commands. To control an agent, click on the agent you wish to move. This &quot;selects&quot; the agent, in quotes because there is currently no indication that the agent has been selected in the GUI. The selected agent can now be moved forward, backward, left or right by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. Only one command can be entered at a time.</p>
	</blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Ability to Bite</p>
    <blockquote>
      If in any iteration an agent is in movement and it is blocked by an agent or object, it performs a <em>bite</em>. If that agent or object is <em>edible</em>, it will take the number of bites as is parameterized by its <em>Bites to die</em>. Edibility is a capable trait of all <a href="objects.html">objects</a>, and thereby agents.
