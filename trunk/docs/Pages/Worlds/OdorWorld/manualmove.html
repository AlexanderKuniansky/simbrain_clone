  <h1>Moving Objects</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p class="heading">Drag the object's icon. </p>
  <p>This is done by placing the cursor over the creature's icon, holding down the left mouse button, and sliding the computer mouse. The creature's icon will move with the cursor until you let up on the left mouse button. The sensory inputs to the network component can either be updated as the creature is dragged or only when the user lets up on the left mouse button. This option is set in the <a href="worlddialog.html">world dialog box</a>. </p>
  <p class="heading">Using arrow keys (for agents) </p>
  <p>Using the computer mouse, click on the creature you wish to move. The creature that was click on can now be moved forward, reverse, left and right by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. The up arrow will move the creature forward, the down arrow will move the creature backward, and the left or right arrows will turn the creature the corresponding left or right directions. Each time an arrow key is pressed, the attached network, if any, is updated and the creature will move slightly in the direction pressed. </p>
