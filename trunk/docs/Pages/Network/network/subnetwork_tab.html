  <h1>Subnetwork Tab </h1>
  </p>
  <p>Subnetworks are marked off by a line surrounding them and a tab in the upper left corner. This tab is your interface with the subnetwork via the GUI. The wording inside it shows what type of subnetwork it is. If you drag the tab, it will drag the entire subnetwork. You can also double-click (to reveal a properties dialog) on the tab or right click on it. Some of the options which show up are specific to the subnetwork type. Standad menu option and other operations available from the subnetwork tab are as follows: </p>
  <p class="heading">Delete</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Deletes the Entire subnetwork. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Double Click</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you double-click on the subnetwork tab it calls up that network's properties dialog. These properties depend on the subnetwork type. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Hide / Show Outline</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hides or reveals the outline drawn around the nodes of that subnetwork </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Randomize</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, this simply calls the randomization method on each neuron, which sets it to a value from within its upper and lower bounds. In some cases it is overridden to perform other operations on the subnetwork as well. For example, backprop network randomization randomizes biases. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Set Properties</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Same as double clicking. Calls up the property dialog for that subnetwork type. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
