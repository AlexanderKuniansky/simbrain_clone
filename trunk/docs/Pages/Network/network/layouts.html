  <h1>Subnetwork Layouts</h1>
  </p>
  <p>Subnetworks are initialized with a pre-defined number of neurons laid out in an appropriate manner. There are typically several options, or layout styles, which are described here. To choose a layout style, click on the <span class="command">Layout</span> tab of the initialization dialog that appears when you create a new subnetwork. </p>
  <p>In each case below, &quot;initial position&quot; corresponnds to the last position clicked on screen, or the upper left corner if no position has been clicked (this is the same as with neurons). </p>
  <p class="heading">Grid</p>
  <p>Neurons are laid out in a grid, beginning at an initial position and moving downward. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">Number of columns:</span> How many columns there will be in the grid.</p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Horizontal Spacing between neurons</span>: Distance between the neurons from left to right. </p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Vertical Spacing between neurons</span>: Distance between the neurons up and down. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Layers</p>
  <p>Currently, subnetworks that have subnetworks as parts use the &quot;layers&quot; layout. It cannot be selected and is thereby invisible to the user. This layout establishes all subnetworks in lines that stack from bottom to top. </p>
  <p class="heading">Line</p>
  <p>Neurons are laid out in a line, beginning at an initial position.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">Layout Style</span>: Whether the neurons are laid out horizontally or vertically.</p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Spacing between neurons</span>: Distance between the neurons.</p>
  </blockquote>
