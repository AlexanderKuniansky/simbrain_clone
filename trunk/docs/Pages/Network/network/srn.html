  <p></p><h1>Simple Recurrent Network</h1>
  
<p>An SRN or Simple Recurrent Network (or Elman Network) is a kind of recurrent network.  According to <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/pdphandbook/handbookch8.html">this site</a>:
"The Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) was conceived and first used by
Jeff Elman, and was first published in a paper entitled Finding
structure in time (Elman, 1990). The paper was ground-breaking for many
cognitive scientists and psycholinguists, since it was the first to
completely break away from a prior commitment to specific linguistic
units (e.g. phonemes or words), and to explore the vision that these
units might be emergent consequences of a learning process operating
over the latent structure in the speech stream. Elman had actually
implemented an earlier model in which the input and output of the
network was a very low-level spectrogram-like representation, trained
using a spectral information extracted from a recording of his own
voice saying 'This is the voice of the neural network'. We will not
discuss the details of this network, except to note that it learned to
produce this utterence after repeated training, and contained no
explicit feature, phoneme, syllable, morpheme, or word-level units.""
