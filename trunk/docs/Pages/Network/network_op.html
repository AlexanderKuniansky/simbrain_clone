  <p></p><h1>Network Operation</h1>
  <p>Each
time the step button is pressed in the network panel--that is, a
default network update occurs. The default "buffered update" updates
all neurons in an asynchronous manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Priority and custom
update are also possible.<br>
</p>
<p>Buffered update.&nbsp; The neural network is essentially a graph, a collection of nodes
connected by vertices (the vertices are neurons and the connections are
synapses). The whole network has three lists: a list of nodes, a list
of connections, and a list of networks ("subnetworks"). The connections
have references to the source and target nodes they connect. When a
network is updated the program goes through the list of neurons and
calls an update function internal to each one, and similarly with the
list of synapses. Buffers are used so that the whole network can be
updated synchronously.</p>
<p align="left">To reflect the fact that the network has been updated the "time" label is updated as well.</p>
