  <h1>Spiking Networks</h1>
  <p>Several neuron types produce discrete &quot;spikes,&quot; that is, instantaneous firing events. When they do, the neuron and the lines leading out from it (the &quot;axon&quot;) turn a different color (by default yellow). This framework is used to create more biologically realistic simulations. In these neurons, the activation--the number in the neuron--is interpreted as a voltage potential, and when that number passes a threshold the neuron &quot;fires,&quot; and typically the activation then drops to a lower value. </p>
  <p>Currently two neurons are spiking neurons:</p>

      <a href="neuron/izhikevich.html">Izhikivech</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The question arises with spiking neurons of how  this discrete &quot;event&quot; can be interpreted by the neurons it connects to. This is handled using a special interface in all synapses fanning out from the spiking neuron. When you double click on one of these synapses, the dialog is as it normally would be for a synapse of that type, but an additional tab is added, a &quot;spike response&quot; tab. This tab determines how spike events will be converted into activation.</p>
  <p>In general, when a spike arrives at a post-synaptic cell (the target neuron of the spiking neuron), a &quot;wave&quot; of activation is created. This is modeled using a &quot;response funnction&quot; which characterizes a synaptic current, the influx of chemicals into a target cell which occurs when vesicles are released from a source neuron. </p>
  <p>Formally, while the <a href="common.html#wtdinput">weighted inputs</a> to a target neuron are usually computed by taking the sum of the source activation times weights at time <em>t</em>, if the source neuron is a spiking cell that term is replaced by:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>weight(<em>t</em>) x response function(<em>t</em>) x [target neuron activation - synaptic resting potential]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The bracketed term is only computed if &quot;scale by PSP&quot; is selected.&quot;  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="heading">Scale by PSP </p>
  <p>If set to true, the response of the response function is multiplied by the differences between the post-synaptic resting potential and the activation of the post-synaptic cell, as described above.</p>
  <p class="heading">Synaptic Resting Potential</p>
  <p>The resting potential used if scale by PSP is selected.</p>
  <p class="heading">Spike Response Function</p>
  <p>Determines the wave form of the response to a spike. There are currently three. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="heading2">Step</p>
    <p>Produce a response of <span class="command">response height</span> for a number of iterations or time-steps corresponding to <span class="command">response time</span>. </p>
    <p class="heading2">Jump and Decay</p>
    <p>Produce a response of <span class="command">jump height</span>, and then decay back to a <span class="command">base-line response</span> at a rate proportional to <span class="command">decay rate</span>.</p>
    <p class="heading2">Rise and Decay</p>
    <p>Rise up to a <span class="command">maximum response</span> and then decay back to baseline at a rate proportional to <span class="command">decay rate</span>. TODO: time-step? No baseline?</p>
