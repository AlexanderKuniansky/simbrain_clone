  <h1>Spiking Networks</h1>
  <p>Several neuron types produce discrete &quot;spikes,&quot; that is, instantaneous firing events. When they do, the neuron and the lines leading out from it (the &quot;axon&quot;) turn a different color (by default yellow). This framework is used to create more biologically realistic simulations. In these neurons, the activation--the number in the neuron--is interpreted as a voltage potential, and when that number passes a threshold the neuron &quot;fires,&quot; and typically the activation then drops to a lower value. </p>
  <p>Currently two neurons are spiking neurons:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="neuron/integrateAndFire.html">Integrate and Fire</a><br>
      <a href="neuron/izhikevich.html">Izhikivech</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The question arises with spiking neurons of how  this discrete &quot;event&quot; can be interpreted by the neurons it connects to. This is handled using a special interface in all synapses fanning out from the spiking neuron. When you double click on one of these synapses, the dialog is as it normally would be for a synapse of that type, but an additional tab is added, a &quot;spike response&quot; tab. This tab determines how spike events will be converted into activation. In general, one of these synapses is referred to as a <a href="synapse/spikeResponder.html">spike responder</a>.</p>
