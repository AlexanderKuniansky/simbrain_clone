<p>Neurons and weights can be selected so that operations can be performed on the selected group of items (e.g., randomizing selected items, adjusting them up or down, etc.) Selecting neurons and weights is important, because many Simbrain operations apply to selected sets of weights and/or nodes. The selection interface basically works the way most computer drawing programs work. Use the left-click button to &quot;lasso&quot; or &quot;rubberband&quot; screen items. Once some items are selected, you can hold down the shift key and single-click to add more items to your selection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> <strong><em>Lasso</em></strong><em>: </em>Left-click and drag the lasso around screen items you want to select. As items are selected a green box appears around them.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Single click</strong></em>: Single left-click on nodes and weights to select individual screen items. Zooming in on items can facilitate this (information on zooming is contained <a href="../commands/toolbar.html">here</a>). </p>
  <p><em><strong>Single click with shift held down</strong></em>: If the shift key is held down, then clicked items which are already selected are deselected and items which have not already been selected are selected. This can be useful for creating a selection of nodes which are far apart from one another. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Keyboard commands:</em></strong> Several keyboard commands facilitate selection of screen items: Keyboard &quot;N&quot; selects all nodes, &quot;W&quot; selects all weights, &quot;A&quot; selects all.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong>Lassoing with the shift-key down will <em>not</em> currently add to the selection, though it will deselect currently selected items.</p>
