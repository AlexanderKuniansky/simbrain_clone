<p class="heading"> <a href="../../SimbrainDocs.html">Simbrain</a> &gt; <a href="../Network.html">Network Component</a> &gt; Overview</p>
<p>The network component is used to build neural networks which simulate circuits in an organism's brain. Shown below is a simple neural network  The colored circles with numbers in the middle represent simplified neurons or &quot;nodes.&quot; The lines between nodes represent synaptic connections between neurons which direct the flow of activity in the network. The smaller blue and red discs at the ends of these lines represent synaptic connections. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../Pics/simple_net.gif" width="373" height="280"></p>
<p>Red nodes represent &quot;excited&quot; neurons, white nodes represent inactive neurons, blue nodes represent &quot;inhibited&quot; neurons. The numbers inside the neurons represent their &quot;activation level&quot; (we can think of the absolute value of this number as representing the rate of a firing of a neuron). Red weights represent excitatory synaptic connections, blue weights represent inhibitory synaptic connections. The diameter of the discs represent their strength (all of the weights above have the same absolute value). Activation flows along the connections in the direction of the discs. Activation flows from left to right in the network above. Since this network is not connected to the world component (it has no <a href="prefs/inoutnodes.html">input or output nodes</a>), to experiment with this network a user would normally adjust the activation of the left-most nodes by hand (see <a href="commands/manualadjust.html">manual adjustment of neurons and weights</a>), and then use the single step key <img src="../../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> to iterate the network (applying the <a href="networkop/updatecycle.html">network update algorithm)</a>.</p>
<p>Simbrain can be used to create a wide variety of neural networks, by creating and connecting nodes (see <a href="editing/buildingnets.html">building networks</a>) and by setting the properties of individual nodes and weights (see <a href="prefs/nodeprefs.html">preferences</a>). Users are advised to consult a reference to neural networks, such as <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/NNcourse/">this one</a>, on the web, for more general information on how neural networks work.</p>
