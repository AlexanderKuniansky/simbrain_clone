<p>The activation value (and hence color) of neurons and the excitatory or inhibitory strength (and hence color and size) of weights can be manually adjusted. To do so, <a href="../editing/selectingitems.html">select</a> one or more neurons and weights (both can be adjusted at the same time), and press the up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease these values. Right and left arrow keys can also be used to increase or decrease these value. </p>
<p>Note that while screen items are selected, neuron values can also be set to zero by pressing &quot;C&quot; on the keyboard (weight values are not then set to zero, because this is equivalent to deleting them, which can be done with the delete key). Pressing &quot;R&quot; will randomize all selected screen items, neurons and weights. </p>
