        <h1>Neuron Group</h1>
        <p>A neuron group is a group consisting of a neuron(s) in which is represented by an enclosure of the neuron(s). The label at the top of the enclosure is the group's name (defaulted to the type of neuron group). There are various types of neuron group (listed to the right) in Simbrain, each of which has numerous parameters that can be set. This page covers properties common to all of the different neuron group types. Details of each type can be found on their respective page. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><span class="heading2">Activation:</span> The current level of activity of this neuron. How this should be interpreted is dependent on the neuron type and application (e.g. firing rate, voltage potential, etc.). This is represented by the neuron's color, and can be seen exactly by lingering over the neuron or observing the value in the neuron's properties.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Label:</span> This field labels ALL of the neurons (within the group) with the same name. </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Clamped:</span> Clamping the neurons fix the activation value to the current value.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Clipping:</span> If a neuron uses clipping, then if its activation exceeds its upper or lower bound, the activation is set to the upper or lower bound that it exceeds. Similarly with weights and their strength.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Upper Bound:</span> This field plays different roles depending on the type of the neuron (documented accordingly) but in general it determines the maximum level of activity of a node. It also determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on. The upper and lower bound determine the bounds of randomization.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Lower Bound:</span> This field plays different roles depending on the type of the neuron but in general it determines the minimum level of activity of a node. It also determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Increment</span>: This field sets the amount that a neuron is incremented when it is manually adjusted. For example, if increment is set to .1, then each time the up arrow is pressed the neuron will increase its activation by .1. This feature does not affect the neuron while the network is being iterated.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Priority:</span> This field lets user give priority to neurons. The lower the value, the higher the priority.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Input Type:</span> This field sets the input as weighted or synaptic. </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Update Rule:</span> This field lets user change the neuron type.</p>
