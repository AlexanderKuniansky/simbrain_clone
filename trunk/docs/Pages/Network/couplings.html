<p align="left"><FONT SIZE="3"><a href="../World.html">Worlds</a> show how neural nets can model the interaction of living organisms with their environment in the real world. </FONT>Nodes which interact with the world can be input nodes, output nodes, or both. To designate one or more nodes as input or output nodes, they are associated with &quot;couplings,&quot; which describe a relation between a neuron and an agent in some world (many times an agent just is a world). This is done using popup menus. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><span class="heading2">Input nodes</span>: are like sensory neurons or receptors, which receive information from the world. They are associated with a sensory coupling. They are designated by an arrow pointing toward the neuron:</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="../../Images/input_node.gif" width="32" height="54"></p>
  <p align="left"><span class="heading2">Output nodes</span>: are like simplified motor neurons which cause the creature to move. They are associated with a motor coupling. They are designated by an arrow pointing out of the neuron:</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="../../Images/output_node.gif" width="32" height="54"></p>
  <p align="left"><span class="heading2">To create a coupling</span>: Right click on a single node, and choose <span class="command">Motor Commands</span> or <span class="command">Sensors</span> from the popup menu. A list of worlds appears. You select a specific sensor or command in a particular world to link the neuron to that sensor or command. How the additional submenus are formatted depends on the commands and sensors available in that world type. For details see: </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><span class="heading2">To remove a coupling</span>: de-designate a node as input or output, choose &quot;Set to non-input mode&quot; or &quot;Set to non-output mode&quot; in the sub-menu. </p>
  <p align="left"><span class="heading2">To see coupling information</span>: To visually see what nodes are coupled to what, select <span class="command">Show I/O Info </span>in the <a href="menu.html#NetworkMenu">network menu</a>. It is suggested that this option be selected when setting the input and output properties of nodes.</p>

  <p><font size="3">The network-world interaction button on the toolbar acts like a two-way valve, which turns the flow of information to and from the world on or off. Each time this button is pressed, it goes to the next mode in a cycle of four modes:</font></p>
