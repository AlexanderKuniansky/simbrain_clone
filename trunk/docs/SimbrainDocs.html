      <td width="770"><p align="left">Simbrain combines three interacting
          components--a neural network, a world, and a set of one or more gauges.
          These components can be used to simulate the way a creature represents
          and navigates its environment. The network simulates the creature's
          brain; the world simulates the creature's environment; the gauges
           plot arbitrary subspaces of the network's neurons and weights. Simbrain
          aims to be as easy-to-use and as self-explanatory as possible. There
          is much you can accomplish by experimentation. For documentation on
          each component, click below, or try this <a href="Pages/QuickStart.html">quick
          start</a> to immediately begin creating simulations with Simbrain.

          more on the design philosophy of Simbrain.</p>

                      The world component of Simbrain
                  simulates the environment of the creature  whose &quot;brain&quot; is
                  represented by the network. Using the world and the network
                  you can study &quot;perception&quot; only, behavior only, or
                  sensorimotor coordination. For example, to study &quot;perception&quot; only,
                  you can manually push the creature around and see how the network
                  responds to different objects.</p></td>

                    Perhaps the most unique aspect of
                Simbrain is its interaction with <a href="http://hisee.sourceforge.net">HiSee</a>,
                a tool for projecting high-dimensional data to two dimensions.
                Arbitrarily many gauges can be created, each of which represents
                an arbitrary dimensional subspace of the network's weights and
                nodes. The patterns which emerge in these gauges show how the
                network of a creature represents its environment. </p></td>
