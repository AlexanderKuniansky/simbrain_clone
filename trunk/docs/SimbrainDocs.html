I have begun to update the &quot;Credits&quot; at the bottom of this page, but otherwise this is Simbrain 2.0 documentation, and you're using an alpha release of Simbrain 3. Much of what's here still applies, in particular most of the neural network stuff, but a lot is missing. If there is anything you have a question about, just email me, jeffyoshimi-at-yahoo-dot-com, or post to the <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Simbrain-f28855.html">forum</a>. If you request documentation for something specific before the official new release (with official documentation) comes out, I can add it to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simbrain/w/list">wiki</a> (and then you can edit it, if you like, since it's a wiki).</p>	<p>&nbsp; </p>	<p>Simbrain is a tool for building artificial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>  that has been developed with the <a href="Pages/Design.html">philosophy</a> of ease-of-use and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch Simbrain and experiment.  For a guided dive directly into Simbrain, try this <a href="Pages/QuickStart.html">quickstart</a>.

These states and the patterns they form can be visually inspected using the gauge components. This allows for visual analysis of the representational structures that develop in a neural network.</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>	</div>	<div class="section">		  <a href="Pages/Samples/Samples.html"><img src="images/workspace.gif" width="150" height="130" border="0" class="floatright" /></a>		<h1><a href="Pages/Samples/Samples.html">Samples</a></h1>		<p>Sample simulations which illustrate various elements of Simbrain.</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>	</div>  </div>	<p align="left"><a name="Credits" id="Credits"></a>Credits</p>	<p align="left"> Simbrain was designed and created by <a href="http://www.jeffyoshimi.net"> Jeff Yoshimi</a>.  </p>	<p align="left">Code committers past and present: Kyle Baron, Ryan Bartley, John Ewart, Ashish Gupta, Michael Heuer, Scott Hotton, Jason Laurel, William Benjamin St. Claire, Mai Ngoc Thang, and James Matthew Watson.</p>	<p align="left">Art and design: David  Fleischmann, Brian Nucum, and Elizabeth Reagh of <a href="http://www.goodformdesign.com/">Goodform Design</a>.
