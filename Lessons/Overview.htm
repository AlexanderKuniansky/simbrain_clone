<p class="heading">Overview</p>
<p>What follows is an introduction to neural networks in cognitive science. </p>
<p>What are neural networks you ask? Very briefly, they are simulated brain or brain-like circuits. They are used in a variety of ways in a wide range of fields, including engineering, biology, psychology, and cognitive science. Our focus is on neural networks in cognitive science. </p>
<p>Often, introductory courses or texts in  neural networks are math intensive, requiring calculus and linear algebra, which is appropriate, since neural networks are mathematical models. But neural networks aren't really that complicated, and given their importance to understanding the mind and brain, there is no reason a wider range of people shouldn't be able to study them. This is an effort to teach neural networks with minimal mathematics; in particular, no calculus (though technical details are included as appendices where appropriate). So, you might think of what follows as &quot;neural networks without calculus.&quot; </p>
<p>In order to give you a concrete understanding of how neural networks work, this course is  designed to be used in conjunction with a computer program, <a href="http://www.simbrain.net">Simbrain.</a> As you go along you can try to test some of these ideas using Simbrain. </p>
