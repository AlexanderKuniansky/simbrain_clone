<h2 class="heading">Overview</h2>
<p>What follows is an introduction to neural networks in cognitive science. Very briefly, neural networks are simulated brain circuits. </p>
<p>Often, introduction to neural networks are math intensive, which is appropriate. But this text attempts to do it without too much math. You might think of this as neural networks without calculus, then. Technical details are, however, included as appendices where appropraite. </p>
<p>This text is desined to be used in conjunction with a computer program, Simbrain, though of course the text can be read independently from that. As you go along you can try to test some of these ideas by using Simbrain simulations or creating simualations of your own in Simbrain. </p>
