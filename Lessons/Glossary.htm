<p><span class="heading">Glossary</span></p>
<p>Activation Space: The set of possible activation vectors for a neural network.</p>
<p>Activation Vector: A vector describing the activation values of the nodes of a neural network.</p>
<p>Artificial neural network: A collection of interconnected units which processes information in a roughly brain-like way</p>
<p>Attractor: a state or set of states A with the property that if you are in a nearby state the system will always go towards A.</p>
<p>Axon: The part of the neuron that carries outgoing signals to other neurons.</p>
<p>Basin of attraction: the set of all states that tend towards a given attractor.</p>
<p>Biological neural network: A set of interconnected neurons in an animal brain</p>
<p>Cognitive science: The interdisciplinary study of mind.</p>
<p>Computational neuroscience: The study of the brain using computer models.</p>
<p>Connectionism: The study of psychological phenomena using artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>Dendrite: The part of the neuron that receives signals from other neurons.</p>
<p>Dynamical system: A rule which tells us what state a system will be in at any future time, given any initial condition.</p>
<p>Initial Condition: the state a dynamical system begins in.</p>
<p>Invariant set: a collection of orbits.</p>
<p>Mathematical Model: An abstract representation of a real process.</p>
<p>Neuron: a cell in the nervous system specialized to transmit information.</p>
<p>Orbit: the set of states that are visited by a dynamical system from an initial condition.</p>
<p>Phase portrait: A picture of a state space with important orbits draw in it.</p>
<p>Projection: A way of representing a group of points in a high-dimensional space in a lower dimensional space.</p>
<p>Repellor: a state or set of states R with the property that if you are in a nearby state the system will always go away from R</p>
<p>Simplifying assumptions: Features of a phenomenon being modeled which are not captured by the model itself.</p>
<p>Soma: The cell body of a neuron.</p>
<p>State Space: the set of possible states of a system.</p>
<p>State: A specification of values for all the variables describing a system. The state of a neural network is typically an activation vector.</p>
<p>Synapse: The junction between nerve cells where a nerve impulse is transferred from one neuron to another.</p>
<p>Vector Valued Function: A function which takes vectors as inputs and produces vectors as outputs.</p>
<p>Vector: An ordered list of numbers. (note that this is a definition for our purposes only; it is not a mathematical definition)</p>
<p>Weight Space: The set of possible weight vectors for a given neural networks.</p>
<p>Weight Vector: A vector describing the strengths of the weights of a neural network.</p>
