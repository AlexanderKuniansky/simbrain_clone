<h2 class="heading"> Lab: A (Modified) Braitenberg Vehicle </h2>
<p>In this example we couple a neural network to a simple environment. The network below controls the little mouse on the right. The mouse is similar to a vehicle described by the neuroscientist Valentino Braitenberg, in his  book, <em>Vehicles</em>. The vehicle occurs in chapter 2 of that book, and is described as being &quot;aggressive,&quot; because it runs up to the thing it's attracted to as if it's attacking it. In this case the mouse will attack the fish.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Attract.jpg" width="736" height="400"></p>
<p>Again begin by clearing the workspace and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear the workspace by using<span class="command"> File &gt; Clear Workspace</span> located in the workspace window.</li>
  <li>Open a workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Open Workspace</span>.</li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons &gt; attract.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the mouse: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To the right of a network is a &quot;world,&quot; in this case an &quot;odor world.&quot;</li>
  <li>Drag the mouse  around within the world.</li>
  <li>Note how depending on whether the mouse is to the left or right of the fish, more or less activation will be on the left or right input node.</li>
  <li>Note how the direction the mouse turns depends on which output node, left or right, has more activation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the fish: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Next move the fish image the same way the mouse was moved within the world frame and note the network reaction.</li>
  <li>Finally, press the <span class="command">play</span> button within the network frame.</li>
  <li>Move the fish around in the world  as indicted above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example uses couplings to send and receive information between the network and world frames which will be covered in more detail later on. </p>
<p class="heading2">Exercises</p>
<p>1. Modify the attract network so that it always turns left.</p>
<p>2. Modify the attract network so that it <em>avoid</em><em>s </em>objects.</p>
<p>3. Create another object which the network ignores.</p>
<p>4. Create a network which is attracted to swiss cheese and avoids fish. <br>
