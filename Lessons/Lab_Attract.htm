<h2 class="heading"> Lab: A (Modified) Braitenberg Vehicle </h2>
<p>In this example we couple a neural network to a simple environment. The network below controls the little mouse on the right. The mouse is similar to a vehicle described by the neuroscientist Valentino Braitenberg, in his  book, <em>Vehicles</em>. The vehicle occurs in chapter 2 of that book, and is described as being &quot;aggressive,&quot; because it runs up to the thing it's attracted to as if it's attacking it. In this case the mouse will attack the fish.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Attract.jpg" width="736" height="400"></p>
<p>Again begin by clearing the workspace and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear the workspace by using<span class="command"> File &gt; Clear Workspace</span> located in the workspace window.</li>
  <li>Open a workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Open Workspace</span>.</li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons &gt; attract.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the mouse: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To the right of a network is a &quot;world,&quot; in this case an &quot;odor world.&quot;</li>
  <li>Drag the mouse  around within the world.</li>
  <li>Note how depending on whether the mouse is to the left or right of the fish, more or less activation will be on the left or right input node.</li>
  <li>Note how the direction the mouse turns depends on which output node, left or right, has more activation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the fish: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Next move the fish image the same way the mouse was moved within the world frame and note the network reaction.</li>
  <li>Finally, press the <span class="command">play</span> button within the network frame.</li>
  <li>Move the fish around in the world  as indicted above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get a feel for how the sensor neurons work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stop the network using the <span class="command">stop button</span>.</li>
  <li>Change the interaction mode by pressing the <span class="command">interaction mode button</span>, located on the right side of the network toolbar. Go into &quot;world-to-network&quot; mode by clicking repeatedly on the button. The button image will change from <img src="images/interaction_mode_both.gif" width="18" height="18"> to <img src="images/interaction_mode_to_network.gif" width="18" height="18">.</li>
  <li> In the world move the mouse to the left side of fish. Note the activation level of the input and output neurons. The sensory neuron corresponding to the left whisker, labelled &quot;Left 1&quot;, will be more active than the sensory neuron corresponding to the right whisker.</li>
  <li>Now move the mouse to right side of fish. Again, note the input and output neuron activation levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Get a feel for how motor neurons work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With the mouse on one side of the fish, making sure that the left or right input and output neurons have different levels of activation, change the interaction mode back to <img src="images/interaction_mode_both.gif" width="18" height="18"> by clicking the <span class="command">interaction mode</span> button several times. </li>
  <li>Step the network using either the <span class="command">step button</span> or  the spacebar. Note that the creature will always move forward since the &quot;forward&quot; neuron is always active, and that it will turn left or right depending on which sensory neuron has more activation.</li>
  <li>The net result is that the mouse will move towards the fish, because when the fish is to the left it moves left, and when it is to the right it moves right, and it always move forward. </li>
</ul>
<p class="heading2">Exercises</p>
<p>1. Modify the<span class="command"> attract.xml</span> network so that the mouse always turns left.</p>
<p>2. Modify the <span class="command"> attract.xml</span> network so that it <em>avoid</em><em>s </em>objects.</p>
<p>3. Create another object (e.g. a piece of Swiss Cheese) which the network does not respond to at all.</p>
<p>4. Create a network which is attracted to swiss cheese and avoids fish. <br>
