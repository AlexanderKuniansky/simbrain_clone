<h2 class="heading"> Lab: Propagation of Activity </h2>
<p align="left">For this example we will not assume any knowledge of the mathematics of neural networks. The goal is simply to play with a neural network and get a sense of the way they channel information, the impacts of changing inputs and weights, and at a very broad level, the structure of learning-as-synaptic modification.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="heading2"> <img src="images/propagation.jpg" width="450" height="450"></p>
<p>Begin by clearing the workspace, and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <span class="command">Workspace</span>, clear workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Clear Workspace</span> from the main window.</li>
  <li>Open a new network  using <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">New Network</span>.</li>
  <li>Open a network file using the menu <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">Open</span>. </li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons</span> &gt; <span class="command">propagation.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now try  changing the bottom row of the neurons (which can be thought of as input neurons):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select bottom neurons using lasso or, alternatively, select neurons individually by holding <span class="command">shift</span> and clicking on each of the six bottom neurons. (These bottom neurons that are now selected can be thought of as input neurons.)</li>
  <li>    Randomize the neurons by pressing <span class="command">R</span> or by pressing the <span class="command">random</span> button (which looks like a die)</li>
  <li>    Iterate the network to see activation propagate through the network's nodes, by pressing either <span class="command">spacebar</span> or the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly. You can also press the <span class="command">play</span> button. </li>
  <li>    Randomize the neurons again as described above and iterate the network through to see new network reactions. </li>
  <li>Alternatively, try pressing the <span class="command">play</span> button and then repeatedly randomizing the bottom row of neurons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next play with changing weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure there is some activity (some color) in the bottom row of neurons.</li>
  <li>Now select all synapses by pressing the <span class="command">W</span> button or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.</li>
  <li>Randomize the weights using <span class="command">R</span> or by clicking the <span class="command">random</span> button above the network.</li>
  <li>Propagate the network using <span class="command">spacebar</span> or clicking the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly until network propagation can no longer be seen.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, press <span class="command">play</span> and then repeatedly press the <span class="command">random</span> button to see how this affects propagation of activity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we modify the synapses so that they can change based on neural activity, which is how learning is modeled in neural networks. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Select all weights by pressing <span class="command">W</span> or using the menu <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.</li>
  <li>Open the synapse dialog box by either double clicking on a synapse or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Set 64 Selected Synapses</span> (if you &quot;miss&quot; you will have to reselect the synapses). </li>
  <li>Using the drop down box, select <span class="command">Hebbian</span> from the list of synapse types and set <span class="command">momentum</span> to 0.1 (or, if you will be using the <span class="command">play</span> button, try .01 or even .001--the smaller the momentum the slower changes happen). </li>
  <li>Now select the bottom row of neurons as described above and randomize the neurons.</li>
  <li>Propagate activity using the <span class="command">spacebar, </span> clicking on the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly, or pressing <span class="command">play</span>. </li>
  <li>Observe changes in the sizes of weights as activity propagates. </li>
  <li>Repeatedly randomize the neurons and observe changes in the weights.</li>
  <li>You can also repeatedly randomize the weights and observe how they change. </li>
</ul>
<p class="heading2">Exercises</p>
<p>1. Modify the  network so that, if the bottom row of nodes are all positive (red), the rest of the network will be all negative.<br> 
2. Modify the network so that, if the bottom row is positive, alternate rows are negative and positive. </p>
