<h2 class="heading"> Lab: Dynamical Systems in Neural Network Theory </h2>
<p align="left" class="heading2">Part 1:  Create a recurrent network </p>
<p align="left">Make a network with four nodes, fully interconnected. To do this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"> 1) Create four nodes by clicking the <span class="command">new neuron</span> button four times.<br>
    2) Connect the four nodes to themselves and the other four nodes. Do this by (1) selecting all the nodes and (2) right click on a target node and select <span class="command">connect</span>. Repeat the process for each successive target node. <br>
    3) Randomize the weights by selecting all weights using &quot;W&quot; (or <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>), and either pressing the <span class="command">randomize button</span> or pressing &quot;R&quot; <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Now look for attractors and limit cycles. You do this by</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1) Selecting all neurons using the keyboard command &quot;N&quot;<br>
  2) Randomizing these neurons by pressing pressing the <span class="command">randomize button</span> or using keyboard command &quot;R&quot;<br>
  3) Be sure to check for the zero vector! You do this by selecting all neurons and pressing &quot;C&quot; or the <span class="command">clear button</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Email me your network then answer the questions below: </p>
<p align="left" class="heading2">Part 2: Answer these questions </p>
<p align="left">Once you've created your network, answer the following questions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1) How many dimensions are in the network's activation space?<br>
    2) How many dimensions is the network's weight space?<br>
  3) How many attractors did you find? List them.<br>
    4) How many repellors did you find? List them. <br>
    5) How many limit cycles did you find? List them and say what vectors make up each one.<br>
  6) For each limit cycle, say what its period is (note that the gauges can be useful in checking this).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><em>Sample answers</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">3) I found 2 attractors. They are (1,1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1,-1)<br>
  4) I found 1 repellor (0,0,0,0)<br>
  5) I found 2 limit cycles: They are: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1: (1,1,-1,1) &gt; (-1,-1,1, -1) <br>
      2: (1,1,1,0) &gt; (1,1,1,.5)</p>

<p align="left" class="heading2">Other Experiments and Notes </p>
<p>By making larger neural networks, with more nodes, you are likely to get more fixed points and more interesting limit cycles.</p>
<p>Conceptually, you can think of each setting of the weights as a point in the 16 dimensional weight space (ok, I just gave away the answer to number 2). Each point in weight space is in turn associated with different numbers of limit cycles and attractors, in activation space. One interesting topic in dynamical systems theory is &quot;bifurcation theory.&quot; In this context, this amounts to slowly changing the weights until you get a change in the number of attractors / limit cycles that can be identified in a network. </p>
