<h2 class="heading"> Lab: Dynamical Systems in Neural Network Theory </h2>
<p align="left">Make a network with four nodes, fully interconnected. To do this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"> 1) Create four nodes by clicking the <span class="command">new neuron</span> button four times.<br>
    2) Connect the four nodes to themselves and the other four nodes. Do this by (1) selecting all the nodes and (2) right click on a target node and select <span class="command">connect</span>. Repeat the process for each successive target node. <br>
    3) Randomize the weights by selecting all weights using &quot;W&quot; (or <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>), and either pressing the <span class="command">randomize button</span> or pressing &quot;R&quot; <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Now look for attractors and limit cycles. You do this by</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1) Selecting all neurons using the keyboard command &quot;N&quot;<br>
    2) Randomizing these neurons by pressing pressing the <span class="command">randomize button</span> or using keyboard command &quot;R&quot; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Be sure to check for the zero vector! You do this by selecting all neurons and pressing &quot;C&quot; or the <span class="command">clear button</span>. </p>
<p align="left">Now, once you've done all this mail me your network and answer the following questons: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1) How many dimensions are in the network's activation space?<br>
    2) How many dimensions is the network's weight space?<br>
    3) How many attractors did you find?<br>
    4) How many repellors did you find?<br>
    5) How many limit cycles did you find?<br>
    6) For each limit cycle, say what its period is. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Another thing you can do is open a gauge while you perform these experiments to watch what happens in the networks' activation space. </p>
