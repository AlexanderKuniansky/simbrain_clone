<h2 class="heading"> Introduction to Neural Networks and Cognitive Modeling </h2>
<p class="heading2">Neural Networks: A first pass</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;neural network&quot; has several meanings. A biological neural network is an actual set of interconnected neurons in, for example, the human brain. Here is a picture of a biological neural network: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	However, &quot;neural network&quot; as we will use the phrase means &quot;artificial neural network,&quot; that is, a <em>simulation</em> of a biological neural network, something inspired by but different than a real set of neurons. </p>
<p>Artificial neural networks are collections of simple processing units connected by weights which process information in a roughly brain-like way. Here are some pictures of artificial neural networks: </p>

<p>The network on the left is a very standard &quot;three layer&quot; network. The one in the middle is also a three layer network, which has been designed to solve a problem in agriculture. The one on the left is a two layer network which was built using &quot;Simbrain,&quot; which you will be using to build your own neural networks soon. </p>
<p>Before moving on, we should not that artificial neural networks go by a variety of names, including: &ldquo;connectionist network.&rdquo;, and &ldquo;PDP (parallel distributed processing) network,&quot; or simply &ldquo;neural network.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Engineering vs. Cognitive Modeling</span></p>
<p>Now, people use neural networks to do lots of things.  Sometimes they are used just to solve industrial problems. I will call this &quot;engineering connectionism.&quot;  And sometimes they are used to try to understand how the mind and / or brain work (if those are really different--a philosophical question).  This is, broadly, &quot;cognitive modeling,&quot; though that in turn can be broken down into different subgroups, which we discuss in another module. So, there is a whole spectrum of approaches from engineering to cognitive modeling: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Eng_Modeling.gif" width="298" height="14"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our focus in these modules is in on cognitive modeling, on neural networks as a tool in cognitive science, used to understand the mind and brain.</p>
<p> But before setting the engineers aside and moving on to cognitive science, it will be useful to briefly describe engineering connectionism, since this will illustrate a little more about what neural networks are.</p>
<p>Neural networks in engineerinng are tools which solve problems. It turns out that neural networks are good at doing certain kinds of thing, like finding patterns in noisy data, controlling certain kinds of machine, and in general dealing with problems that involves lots of variables that are hard to deal with explicitly. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The most natural application areas for the NNs are obviously tasks in which appropriate transformations from certain inputs to certain outputs should be established, but the transformations cannot be discovered analytically due to a variety of reasons. Therefore it is no wonder that the most successful applications of the NNs can be found in the areas of machine vision, pattern recognition, motor control, signal processing, etc., where such inputs to outputs transformations dominate the problem solving (see e.g. [1, 10, 2]).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People who do that don&rsquo;t care about how the brain works or how we think: they want to make a machine that works. That rice cooker better make good rice, whether it thinks right or not. </p>
<p>Consider an example. The lumber industry has a need to classify pieces of wood into different grades based on what type of defects they contain, according to some pre-set standard. The Finnish standards involve over 30 categories of wood defect, based on different qualitiy classes based on the numer of knots in a variety of &quot;knot clases.&quot; Shown here are some examples:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wood_network_stimuli.jpg" width="352" height="264"></p>
<p>A human can classify these knots reasonably well, but it is time-consuming, error-prone (just look at how subtle the differences are!), and expensive. The lumber industry would like a way to automate the process. But it's hard to classify these things according to any kind of rule.</p>
<p>A neural network can be used to solve the problem reasonably well, in fact better than human graders. A neural network has about 90% accuracy in this process, compared with 70-80% accuracy by humans. </p>
<p>How does it do this? It is shown a whole bunch of examples, and told how they should be classified. Its connections are then slowly updated so as to reduce the number of mistakes it makes. The network picks up on statistical regularities in the data it's presented with, and ends up doing a pretty good job. Here is a flowchart of the system they used to solve the problem: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wood_network_flowchart.jpg" width="586" height="275"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, a few things worth noting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. Notice that the neural network is buried way inside this machine. It is the &quot;MLP classifier&quot; towards the right (&quot;MLP&quot; means &quot;multi-layer-percepron,&quot; and is a kind of network discussed in another module later). Often times machines (and our bodies) have to do a lot of pre- and post-processing before something is ready to be dealt with by neurons or in this case neuron-like elements.<br>
    2. The network deals with a special kind of data: lists of numbers. A neural network can't do anything unless it is given numerical data, in the form of <em>vectors</em>, that is, ordered sets of numbers. The machine depicted above looks at a piece of wood, does awhole bunch of processing, and then summarizes features and colors of a sample via a ste of numbers. This is then fed in to the &quot;MLP processor.&quot; It produces a set of numebrs which describe how decayed, burnt, dry, round, and so forth each sample is. These numbers are then used to say what knot class a sample exhibitis. We will see that it is important in looking at neural networks to understand how, in any particular case, data is turned into vector format so that it can be used by a neural network. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even though these guys aren't trying to model the mind or brain, they are using brain-like computers to do something we ourselves do: look at lots of data and extract statistical regularities via learning. </p>
<p>In what follows we will mention engineering work, especially in the discussion of backpropagation, but our focus will be on the cognitive modeling end of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="heading2">Cognitive Science</p>
<p>Our focus is on cognitive modeling, the way neural networks are used in cognitive science. In these cases neural networks are models of brain processes or mental proceses or both. Cognitive modelers aren&rsquo;t trying to solve engineering problems, they are trying to understand the way the human mind works. Errors are bad for engineers, but useful for cognitive science. Humans make errors. We can&rsquo;t add big numbers all too well. A cheap calculator kicks our butt on that one. The engineers have that mastered, and it&rsquo;s clearly not the same as a human. But if we could make a neural network which added and had the same trouble we do, that would be interesting. It would tell us something about how our minds and brains solve that particular problem. So, we&rsquo;ve got a kind of continuum (it&rsquo;s really more discrete, like an on-off switch), but there are a variety of commitments to engineering or cognitive modeling respectively. </p>
<p>Since we focus on neural networks in cognitive science, let us begin by saying what cognitive science is.</p>
<p>Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. It draws on such diverse fields as psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, and others. Not all these people are cognitive scientists, but there are some people in each of those fields who do work in cognitive science. </p>
<p>What these people have in common is that they want to know how the mind works.  The mind really is remarkable. Let&rsquo;s take an example. When I go to the store and buy a loaf of bread, I <strong>perceive</strong> cans and boxes, and vegetables and other things. I <strong>recognize</strong> these as boxes, cans, vegetables and so forth. I successfully <strong>control</strong> my body in a complex environment: I am able to push a shopping cart around other shoppers who hurtle by and retrieve loaves of bread from crowded shelves. I <strong>remember</strong> what I am supposed to buy and plan ahead for dinner that night and all week. I easily find the things I need because I&rsquo;ve been to this store before and have <strong>learned</strong> about its spatial layout. I see someone I know in the store and <strong>talk</strong> to him briefly.</p>
<p>That I can do all this so well is remarkable. You may not be impressed but you&rsquo;re another human. Try to build a robot to do one or two these things, let alone all of them, as quickly and effortlessly as we humans do. And we do it using this wet hunk of organic material in our skulls. Millions of firing neurons somehow allow us to perceive, recognized, control, remember, plan, learn, and talk all day every day. How on earth does this work? That&rsquo;s what cognitive scientists are trying to figure out.</p>
<p>This may seem like psychology to you. And it is. Psychologists study this stuff by putting people in controlled experimental situations and recording what they do. For the most part they study behavior: if we show people these stimuli, how will they respond? But the behavioral data is just part of the story. There are other ways to try to understand how I did so well at getting that bread. Computer scientists and engineers write computer programs or build robots which try to do all the things we do. Neuroscientists study the brain by measuring its activity, in an effort to understand the physical mechanisms which allow us to behave so successfully in the world. Linguistics study language by, for example, studying sets of sentences which are and are not considered grammatical and proposing theories which explain the difference. Philosophers look at all this data and, especially in cases where experimental data is not available, attempt to interpret it and synthesize it into general theories of how the mind and brain work.</p>
<p class="heading2">Information Processing </p>
<p>So cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. There are many specific ways to spin this; there are many particular ways of studying the mind and brain. What cognitive scientists tend to share is a focus on information processing in the mind and brain.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Although each discipline has its own unique interpretation of cognitive science, they are bound into a cohesive whole by a central tenet. This tenet states that the mind is an information processor; that is, it receives, stores, retrieves, transforms, and transmits information&quot; ([105], p. 1). Medler, quoting Aizawa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may help to consider some historical context here. Cognitive science is often traced to one of several conferences in the 1950&rsquo;s, including in particular a conference held at MIT in 1956, the Symposium on Information Theory:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Three talks in particular, Miller's The magical number seven, Chomsky's Three models of language, and Newell and Simon's Logic theory machine, have been singled out as instrumental in seeding the cognitive science movement. Following these talks, a perception began to emerge that &ldquo;human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and computer simulations of cognitive processes were all pieces of a larger whole&quot; (Miller, 1979; p. 9; cited in [36], p. 29).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big idea, that idea that got everyone excited, was based on the observation that the mind and brain are like a computer in that they takes in information (in the form of sensory processes), process it internally, and then produce output (in the form of behavioral response). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/BasicProcessing.gif" width="251" height="60"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brain is clearly like this: Inputs = sensory neurons, Outputs = motor neurons, Processing = brain. And so is the mind abstractly: Inputs = seeing things, outputs = doing things, processing = thinking. So, the new generation thought, the mind itself is an information processing device, and we can use computers and mathematics together with psychology and neuroscience and all the rest to understand the way it processes information. We will simulate that &quot;processing&quot; box and see how it works.</p>
<p>Note that this was in part a response to the older behaviorism, which said you shouldn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;inside the mind at all,&rdquo; and just look at inputs and outputs. The new cognitive scientists wanted to break open the black box and look inside at the guts: the processing the mind and brain do. And they had these new devices, electronics computers, to help them do it.</p>
<p>This new breed of inter-disciplinary scientists would split according to how they thought the mind processes information. Some thought (and think) the mind processes information using symbols and rules, like a regular computer does. This remains the dominant tenedency in cognitive science, and is sometimes called the &ldquo;rules and representations&rdquo; or &ldquo;symbolic AI&rdquo; approach. The other camp thought the mind processes information more like the brain does. We will focus on the second camp, the &ldquo;connectionists.&rdquo; Today there are other camps, and some who mix ideas from both symbolic AI and connectionism. </p>
