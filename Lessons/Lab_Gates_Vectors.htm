<h2 class="heading"> Lab: Activation Functions, Vectors, and Vector-valued Functions </h2>
<p align="left">For this lab you will make some very simple networks. You will need to be able to do a few basic things in order to complete this lab:</p>
<p align="left">1) Connect neurons by selecting on one or more &quot;source&quot; neurons, right clicking on the &quot;target neuron&quot; and select <span class="command">connect neurons.</span> <br>
  2) Create agents by right clicking on an OdorWorld and selecting <span class="command">Add new agent.</span><br>
3) Create objects by right clicking on an OdorWorld and selecting <span class="command">Add new object.</span></p>
<p align="left">When you complete the assignment, select <span class="command">workspace &gt; export workspace</span>. This will create a folder with the name you choose for it.  It would help if you zipped this file up before emailing it to me. <br>
</p>
<p align="left" class="heading2">Exercises</p>
<p>1. Make a network with four neurons, each connected to the next. The first neuron should be clamped. Now modify the network parameters so that each succeeding neuron in the chain has a lower absolute value than the one before it.</p>
<p>2. Make a network which computes this vector valued function, which reacts with a 1 only to inputs with two or more ones. Make the input nodes clamped, with an increment of 1, upper bound 1, and lower bound 0. </p>
