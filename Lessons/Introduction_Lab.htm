<h2 class="heading"> Introduction to Neural Networks in Cognitive Science: Lab </h2>
<p class="heading2">Example 1: Simple propagation</p>
<p align="center" class="heading2"><img src="images/propagation.jpg" width="450" height="450"></p>
<p>For this example we will not assume any detailed knowledge of how neural networks work. The idea is simply to play with a neural network and get a sense of the way they channel information from inputs to outputs. </p>
<p>Begin by clearing the workspace, and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <span class="command">Workspace</span>, clear workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Clear Workspace</span> from the main window.</li>
  <li>Open a new network frame using <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">New Network</span>.</li>
  <li>Open a network file within the new network frame by <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">Open</span>. </li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons</span> &gt; <span class="command">propagation.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now play with changing inputs and fixed weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select bottom neurons using lasso or, alternativly, select neurons individually by holding <span class="command">shift</span> and clicking on each of the six bottom neurons. (These bottom neurons that are now selected can be thought of as input neurons.)</li>
  <li>    Randomize the neurons by pressing <span class="command">R</span> or by pressing the <span class="command">dice</span> button above the network.</li>
  <li>    Iterate the network to see network reaction by pressing either <span class="command">spacebar</span> or the <span class="command">step</span> button until no network reaction can be seen.</li>
  <li>    Randomize the neurons again as described above and iterate the network through to see new network reactions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, pressing the <span class="command">play</span> button and then randomizing neurons will automatically iterate the network  without the need to press <span class="command">spacebar</span> or <span class="command">step</span> multiple times, however, network reactions may be more difficult to see depending on computer configuration. </p>
<p>Next play with changing weights and fixed inputs: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Now select all synapses, or weights, by pressing the <span class="command">W</span> button or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.</li>
  <li>Randomize the weights using <span class="command">R</span> or by clicking the <span class="command">random</span> button above the network.</li>
  <li>Propagate the network using <span class="command">spacebar</span> or clicking the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly until network propagation can no longer be seen.</li>
  <li>Repeat randomizing and propagating until network reactions are understood.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A similar method of pressing the play button can also be performed to view an automatic progression of changes along the network.</p>
<p>Finally play with a learning rule, Hebb:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select all weights by pressing <span class="command">W</span> or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.</li>
  <li>Change the synapse type to hebbian by using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Set 64 Selected Synapses</span>.</li>
  <li>Using the drop down box, select <span class="command">Hebbian</span> from the list of synapse types and set <span class="command">momentum</span> to 0.1.</li>
  <li>Now select the input neurons using the aforementioned method and randomize the neurons.</li>
  <li>Propagate activity using the <span class="command">spacebar</span> or clicking on the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly until no network reaction can been seen.</li>
  <li>Repeat randomizing the neurons and propagating activity until the network reactions are understood.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="heading2">Example 2: A Braitenberg Vehicle </span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Attract.jpg" width="736" height="400"></p>
<p>For this example we will use a network to control behavior. Attract.</p>
<p>Again begin by clearing the workspace and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear the workspace by using<span class="command"> File &gt; Clear Workspace</span> located in the workspace window.</li>
  <li>Open a workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Open Workspace</span>.</li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons &gt; attract.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the mouse: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The frame within the workspace that is on the left side should look like the familiar network frame, the new frame on the right is the world frame. The world used in this example is known as an odor world.</li>
  <li>Using the pointer, hover over the image of the mouse within the world frame and<span class="command"> press and hold</span> the left mouse button.</li>
  <li>Move the mouse image around within the world by moving the pointer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play with the fish: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Next move the fish image the same way the mouse was moved within the world frame and note the network reaction.</li>
  <li>Finally, press the <span class="command">play</span> button within the network frame.</li>
  <li>Move the fish around in the world  as indicted above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example uses couplings to send and receive information between the network and world frames which will be covered in more detail later on. </p>
<p class="heading2">Assignment</p>
