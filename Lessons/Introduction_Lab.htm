<h2 class="heading"> Introduction to Neural Networks in Cognitive Science: Lab </h2>
<p class="heading2">Example 1: Simple propagation</p>
<p>For this example we will not assume any detailed knowledge of how neural networks work. The idea is simply to play with a neural network and get a sense of the way they channel information from inputs to outputs. </p>
<p>Begin by clearing the workspace, and opening a sample file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <span class="command">Workspace</span>, clear workspace using <span class="command">File &gt; Clear Workspace</span>.</li>
  <li>Open a new network frame using <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">New Network</span>.</li>
  <li>Open a network file within the new network frame by <span class="command">File</span> <span class="command">&gt;</span> <span class="command">Open</span>. </li>
  <li>Select <span class="command">lessons</span> &gt; <span class="command">propagation.xml</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now play with changing inputs and fixed weights:</p>
<p>Select bottom neurons using lasso or, alternativly, select neurons individually by holding <span class="command">shift</span> and clicking on each of the six bottom neurons. (These bottom neurons that are now selected can be thought of as input neurons.)<br>
  Randomize the neurons by pressing <span class="command">R</span> or by pressing the <span class="command">dice</span> button above the network.<br>
  Iterate the network to see network reaction by pressing either <span class="command">spacebar</span> or the <span class="command">step</span> button until no network reaction can be seen.<br>
  Randomize the neurons again as described above and iterate the network through to see new network reactions. </p>
<p>Alternatively, pressing the <span class="command">play</span> button and then randomizing neurons will automatically iterate the network  without the need to press <span class="command">spacebar</span> or <span class="command">step</span> multiple times, however, network reactions may be more difficult to see depending on individual computer configuration. </p>
<p>Open the network... aclear stuff out, lessons &gt; propagation</p>
<p>which we can think of as inputs neurons.</p>
<p>Press R or the rand button</p>
<p>Press space or the step button </p>
<p>Notice activity propagates.</p>
<p>You can also press play and, with inputs selected, repeatedly press the random button or R </p>
<p>PLAY WITH CHANGING WEIGHTS AND FIXED INPUTS </p>
<p>Now select all synapses, or weights, by pressing the <span class="command">W</span> button or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.<br>
  Randomize the weights using <span class="command">R</span> or by clicking the <span class="command">random</span> button above the network.<br>
  Propagate the network using <span class="command">spacebar</span> or clicking the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly until network propagation can no longer be seen.<br>
  Repeat randomizing and propagating until network reactions are understood. </p>
<p>A similar method of pressing the play button can also be performed to view an automatic progression of changes along the network.</p>
<p>Now try randomizing weights.</p>
<p>Press w or select all weights</p>
<p>randomize</p>
<p>again propagate activity</p>
<p>now try changing a neuron  </p>
<p>PLAY WITH A LEARNING RULE, HEBB</p>
<p>Select all weights by pressing <span class="command">W</span> or using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Select &gt; Select All Weights</span>.<br>
  Change the synapse type to hebbian by using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Set 64 Selected Synapses</span>.<br>
  Using the drop down box, select <span class="command">Hebbian</span> from the list of synapse types and set <span class="command">momentum</span> to 0.1.<br>
  Now select the input neurons using the aforementioned method and randomize the neurons.<br>
  Propagate activity using the <span class="command">spacebar</span> or clicking on the <span class="command">step</span> button repeatedly until no network reaction can been seen.<br>
Repeat randomizing the neurons and propagating activity until the network reactions are understood. </p>
<p>select all weights</p>
<p>change to Hebbian</p>
<p>change momentum to .1</p>
<p>select inputs and randomize, while playing </p>

</p>
<p>For this example we will use a network to control behavior. Attract.</p>
<p>We will learn more about couplings later. </p>
<p class="heading2">Assignment</p>
<p>Try to build a vehicle which tried to get away from things.</p>
