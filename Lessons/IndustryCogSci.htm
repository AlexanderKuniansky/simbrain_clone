 <span class="heading">Neural Networks in Industry and Cognitive Science </span>
 <p class="heading2">Neural Networks: A first pass</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;neural network&quot; has several meanings. A biological neural network is an actual set of interconnected neurons in an animal  brain (for example, the human brain). Here is a picture of a biological neural network: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/real_neural_net.gif" width="345" height="190"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	However, &quot;neural network&quot; as we will use the phrase means &quot;artificial neural network,&quot; that is, a <em>simulation</em> of a biological neural network, something inspired by but different from a real set of neurons. </p>
<p>Artificial neural networks are collections of simple processing units connected by weights which process information in a roughly brain-like way. Here are some pictures of artificial neural networks: </p>

<p>The artificial neural network on the left is a  standard &quot;three layer&quot; network. The one in the middle is also a three layer network, which has been designed to solve a problem in agriculture. The one on the right is a two layer network which was built using &quot;Simbrain,&quot; which you will be using to build your own neural networks soon. </p>
<p class="heading2">Nomenclature</p>
<p>Before moving on, we should note that artificial neural networks go by a variety of names, including: &ldquo;connectionist network.&rdquo;, and &ldquo;PDP (parallel distributed processing) network,&quot; or simply &ldquo;neural network.&quot;</p>
<p class="heading2">Engineering vs. Cognitive Modeling</p>
<p>People use neural networks to do lots of things.  Sometimes they are used  to solve industrial problems. I will call this &quot;engineering connectionism.&quot;  And sometimes they are used to try to understand how the mind and / or brain work (if those are really different--a philosophical question).  This is, broadly, &quot;cognitive modeling,&quot; though that in turn can be broken down into different subgroups, which we discuss in another module. </p>
<p>So, there is a whole spectrum of approaches from engineering to cognitive modeling: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Eng_Modeling.gif" width="298" height="14"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our focus in these modules is in on cognitive modeling, on neural networks as a tool in cognitive science, used to understand the mind and brain.</p>
<p> But before setting the engineers aside and moving on to cognitive science, it will be useful to briefly describe engineering connectionism, since this will illustrate a little more about what neural networks are.</p>
<p>Neural networks in engineering are tools which solve problems. It turns out that neural networks are good at doing certain kinds of thing, like finding patterns in noisy data, controlling certain kinds of machine, and in general dealing with problems that involves lots of variables that are hard to deal with explicitly. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The most natural application areas for the NNs are obviously tasks in which appropriate transformations from certain inputs to certain outputs should be established, but the transformations cannot be discovered analytically due to a variety of reasons. Therefore it is no wonder that the most successful applications of the NNs can be found in the areas of machine vision, pattern recognition, motor control, signal processing, etc., where such input to output transformations dominate the problem solving (see e.g. [1, 10, 2]).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Engineers who use neural networks for these purposes  don&rsquo;t care about how the brain works or how we think: they want to make a machine that works. A neural-network based rice cooker better make good rice, whether it thinks like we do or not. </p>
<p>Consider an example. The lumber industry has a need to classify pieces of wood into different grades based on what type of defects they contain, according to some pre-set standard. The Finnish standards involve over 30 categories of wood defect, which are in turn based on different &quot;knot classes.&quot; Shown here are a few examples:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wood_network_stimuli.jpg" width="352" height="264"></p>
<p>A human can classify these knots reasonably well, but it is time-consuming, error-prone (just look at how subtle the differences are in the knots above), and expensive. The lumber industry would like a way to automate the process. </p>
<p>So, how can we automatically classify knots? It's hard to classify them according to any kind of rule. But a neural network can be used to solve the problem reasonably well, in fact better than human graders. A neural network has about 90% accuracy in this process, compared with 70-80% accuracy by humans. How does it achieve this? It is shown a whole bunch of examples, and told how they should be classified. Its connections are then slowly updated so as to reduce the number of mistakes it makes. The network picks up on statistical regularities in the data it's presented with, and ends up doing a pretty good job. Here is a flowchart of the system the engineers used to solve the problem: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/wood_network_flowchart.jpg" width="586" height="275"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, a few things worth noting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. Notice that the neural network is buried way inside this machine. It is the &quot;MLP classifier&quot; towards the right (&quot;MLP&quot; means &quot;multi-layer-percepron,&quot; and is a kind of network discussed in another module later). Oftentimes machines (and our bodies) have to do a lot of pre- and post-processing before something is ready to be dealt with by neurons or in this case neuron-like elements.<br>
    2. The network deals with a special kind of data: lists of numbers. A neural network can't do anything unless it is given numerical data, in the form of <em>vectors</em>, that is, ordered sets of numbers (more on vectors later). The machine depicted above looks at a piece of wood, does a bunch of processing, and then summarizes features and colors of a sample via a list of numbers. These numbers are then fed in to the &quot;MLP processor.&quot; It transforms these numbers into another list  of numbers which describe how decayed, burnt, dry, round, and so forth each sample is. These numbers are then used to say what knot class a sample exhibits. We will see that it is important in looking at neural networks to understand how, in any particular case, data is turned into a numerical format so that it can be used by a neural network. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though these guys aren't trying to model the mind or brain, they are using brain-like computers to do something we ourselves do: look at lots of data and extract statistical regularities via learning.</p>
<p class="heading2">Cognitive Science</p>
<p>In what follows we will mention engineering work, especially in the discussion of backpropagation, but our focus will be on the cognitive modeling end of the spectrum, on the way neural networks are used in cognitive science. Cognitive modelers aren&rsquo;t trying to solve engineering problems, they are trying to understand the way the human mind works. </p>
<p>To see the difference between engineering and cognitive science approaches to neural networks, consider the status of errors in each case. Errors are bad for engineering, but useful for cognitive science. Humans make errors. For example, we can&rsquo;t add big numbers  too well. A cheap calculator creams us pretty easily. To a cognitive scientist, these errors provide valuable information. A cognitive scientist would be interested in designing a neural network which make the same errors we do. This would tell us something about how the brain solves addition problems. </p>
<p>Since we focus on neural networks in cognitive science, let us begin by saying something about what cognitive science is.</p>
<p>Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. It draws on such diverse fields as psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, and others. Not all of these people are cognitive scientists, but there are some people in each of those fields who do work in cognitive science. </p>
<p>What these people have in common is that they want to know how the mind works.  The mind really is remarkable. Let&rsquo;s take an example. When I go to the store and buy a loaf of bread, I <strong>perceive</strong> cans, boxes,  vegetables and other things. I <strong>recognize</strong> these as boxes, cans, vegetables and so forth. I successfully <strong>control</strong> my body in a complex environment: I am able to push a shopping cart around other shoppers who hurtle by and retrieve loaves of bread from crowded shelves. I <strong>remember</strong> what I am supposed to buy and plan ahead for dinner that night and all week. I easily find the things I need because I&rsquo;ve been to this store before and have <strong>learned</strong> about its spatial layout. I see someone I know in the store and <strong>talk</strong> to him briefly.</p>
<p>That I can do all this so well is remarkable. You may not be impressed but you&rsquo;re another human. Try to build a robot to do one or two these things, let alone all of them, as quickly and effortlessly as we humans do. And we do it using this wet hunk of organic material in our skulls. Millions of firing neurons somehow allow us to perceive, recognize, control, remember, plan, learn, and talk all day every day. How on earth does this work? That&rsquo;s what cognitive scientists are trying to figure out.</p>
<p>This may seem like psychology to you. And it is. Psychologists study this stuff by putting people in controlled experimental situations and recording what they do. For the most part they study behavior: if we show people these stimuli, how will they respond? But the behavioral data is just part of the story. There are other ways to try to understand how I did so well at getting that bread. Computer scientists and engineers write computer programs or build robots which try to do all the things we do. Neuroscientists study the brain by measuring its activity, in an effort to understand the physical mechanisms which allow us to behave so successfully in the world. Linguists study language by, for example, studying sets of sentences which are and are not considered grammatical and proposing theories which explain the difference. Philosophers look at all this data and, especially in cases where experimental data is not available, attempt to interpret it and synthesize it into general theories of how the mind and brain work.</p>
<p class="heading2">Information Processing and the Origins of Cognitive Science </p>
<p>So cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. There are many specific ways to spin this; there are many particular conceptions of cognitive science and what it is. But one bedrock, nearly universal belief among cognitive scientists is that the mind and brain can be understood as processing information:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Although each discipline has its own unique interpretation of cognitive science, they are bound into a cohesive whole by a central tenet. This tenet states that the mind is an information processor; that is, it receives, stores, retrieves, transforms, and transmits information&quot; ([105], p. 1). Medler, quoting Aizawa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may help to consider some historical context here. Cognitive science is often traced to one of several conferences in the 1950&rsquo;s, including in particular a conference held at MIT in 1956, the Symposium on Information Theory:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Three talks in particular, Miller's The magical number seven, Chomsky's Three models of language, and Newell and Simon's Logic theory machine, have been singled out as instrumental in seeding the cognitive science movement. Following these talks, a perception began to emerge that &ldquo;human experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and computer simulations of cognitive processes were all pieces of a larger whole&quot; (Miller, 1979; p. 9; cited in [36], p. 29).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The big idea, the idea that got everyone excited, was that the mind and brain have a formal, information processing structure, one that can be simulated on a computer. What specific form this processing takes is controversial, but at a general level this point is pretty obvious. The mind and brain take in information, process it internally, and then produce output:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/BasicProcessing.gif" width="251" height="60"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brain is clearly like this: inputs = sensory neurons, outputs = motor neurons, processing = brain activity. And so is the mind abstractly: inputs = seeing things, outputs = doing things, processing = thinking. So, the new generation thought, the mind itself is an information processing device, and we can use computers and mathematics  to understand the way it processes information. </p>
<p>Note that this was in part a response to the older behaviorism, which said psychologists should just look at inputs and outputs. The new cognitive scientists wanted to break open the black box and also look inside at the guts: the processing the mind and brain do when coordinating inputs and outputs. </p>
<p class="heading2">A Brief History  of Connectionism</p>
<p>This new breed of inter-disciplinary scientists would split according to how they thought the mind processes information. Some thought (and think) the mind processes information using symbols and rules, like a regular computer does. This remains the dominant tendency in cognitive science, and is sometimes called the &ldquo;rules and representations, &ldquo;Symbolic AI,&rdquo; or &quot;Classical AI&quot;  approach. The other camp thought the mind processes information more like the brain does. </p>
<p>We will focus on the second camp, the &ldquo;connectionists.&rdquo; Today there are other camps as well, and some who mix ideas from both symbolic AI and connectionism. We will go into this difference in detail in another module, but it will be useful to briefly put the connectionist branch in historical context. </p>
<p>Cognitive science, the interdisciplinary study of mind, has fairly ancient roots. In the Western tradition, Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers clearly had an interest in the structure and function of the human mind, a topic which was taken up by medieval thinkers (who saw the mind as as arising from a complex play of humors and vital spirits in the ventricles of the brain). During the enlightenment, the notion that the mind just is the brain was first investigated in detail, and various thinkers from the era proposed that connections between ideas in the mind are based on connections between fibers in the brain (neurons had not yet been identified as distinct structures). </p>
<p>In the 20th century there were numerous lines of study prior to the MIT conference that prepared the way for cognitive science, and connectionism in particular. Prominent among the new paradigms was Cybernetics, &ldquo;the science of control and communication in the animal and the machine&rdquo; (Wiener, 16). Early cybernetics was fueled by industry and war.&nbsp; In the late 1930&rsquo;s the petroleum industry developed central control systems to maintain refinery towers.&nbsp;&nbsp; These feedback systems were pressed into military service during WWII, when engineers were asked to design more efficient mechanisms for controlling anti-aircraft guns. Before long, these engineering techniques were applied to the study of mind. Those working in this area were impressed by the parallels between mechanical controls systems and the human brain.</p>
<p>The first connectionists were affiliated with the cybernetics movement: Warren


McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These thinker showed that neuron-like elements, operating in parallel, could perform the logical operations performed by computers. This in turn implies that whatever can be done on a computer can, in principle, be done using neurons. Here is one of their diagrams:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/%20McCullochPitts.jpg" width="431" height="227"> </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">After the MIT conference and the birth of cognitive science, work along these lines continued, in particular work by Rosenblatt in the 1950's and 1960's, who showed how simple networks could be made to recognize patterns. </p>
<p align="left">However, Rosenblatt's networks were shown to suffer a fundamental limitation, and for this and other reasons work in connectionism went quiescent in the 1970's (though important work was done). These have been called the &quot;dark ages&quot; of connectionism, though it was only a decade or so, and lots of good stuff happened during that decade. One particularly important researcher of the period is Valentino Braitenberg, who's little book <em>Vehicles</em> will be discussed in several places in these modules. </p>
<p align="left">Connectionism came out of its dark decade and enjoyed a resurgence in interest in the 1980s, due to a number of important lines of research, but especially because of the publication of the two-volume work, <em>Parallel Distributed Processing</em>, in 1988, by a group of researchers at UC San Diego. </p>
<p align="left">Today connectionism and artificial intelligence are both live and active areas of research within cognitive science. The modules which follow introduce you to connectionist cognitive science. </p>
