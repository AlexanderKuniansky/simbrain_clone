<h1>Examples</h1>
<br>

<p>Here are some quick tutorials on how to do specific things in
Simbrain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basics of building a network and other
simple examples are covered in the <a href="QuickStart.html">quick-start</a>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="heading">Plot the activation of a node over time.<br>
</span></p>
<p>Create a <a href="Network.html">neural network</a> and a <a href="Plot/time_series.html">time series plot</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will now creating&nbsp; a <a href="Workspace/Couplings.html">coupling</a>
from a node in the neural network to a time series in the
plot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is as follows.&nbsp; Right
click on the node whose activation you want to plot, and in the context
menu go to&nbsp;<span class="command">Send coupling to &gt; TimeSeriesPlot1 &gt; Series0.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(TimeSeriesPlot1 is the name of the time series plot. If you have
multiple plots open it might be a different name.&nbsp; Series0 is a
particular time series in the plot.) &nbsp; By repeating this for
different nodes you can plot the activation of multiple neurons at
once. &nbsp;If you want to add more time series beyond the default 5, click "add" in the time series component.&nbsp;  <br>
</p>
<p>Now run your simulation and you should see a plot of the changing
activation of the neuron.&nbsp; For some purposes it helps to turn
"auto range" off in the time series preferences, and manually set&nbsp;
upper and lower bounds.<br>
