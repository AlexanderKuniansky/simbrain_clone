<p>When Simbrain is first opened nothing happens. A sample network sits passively before the user. When the user &quot;runs&quot; the network it comes to life--an <a href="network_op.html">update algorithm </a>is repeatedly called, which is visible in the form of spreading activity in network's nodes and (if learning is activated) changing weight sizes. The network can be run in any of the following ways: </p>
<p class="heading">Run the network. </p>
<p>Press the play button <img src="../../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> in the tool-bar to repeatedly iterate the network. Note that the image on the button becomes that of a &quot;stop&quot; button <img src="../../Pics/Stop.gif" width="18" height="18">. Pressing this button will stop the network. Thus the play/stop button acts as a toggle switch. </p>
<p class="heading">Step the network </p>
<p>Press the step button <img src="../../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> or press &quot;space&quot; or &quot;s&quot; in the keyboard to iterate the network a single time. Sometimes repeatedly hitting the space bar is useful way to test a network. (Note that &quot;s&quot; is special in that it overrides the <a href="networldbutton.html">network-world interaction</a> button and only updates the network).</p>
<span class="heading">World-based iteration</span>
<p>The network will also run if an appropriate action is taken in one of the open and coupled worlds (assuming<a href="networldbutton.html"> network-world interaction</a> is set to both-ways or world-to-network). For example, moving a creature in an <a href="../Worlds/OdorWorld/OdorWorld.html">OdorWorld</a> will update all connected networks. </p>
