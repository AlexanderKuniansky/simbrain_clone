Each gauge   is an instance of a program called <A HREF="http://hisee.sourceforge.net">HiSee</A>.       HiSee is a high dimensional visualizer. As a neural net operates its state      travels along a path in its state space which typically has many dimensions.      Hisee can take the collection of states which are visited by a neural net      and project them down into two dimensions so that many of their geometric      and topological properties are preserved. This gives users of Simbrain      a way to visualize the behavior of the network component. More information      about HiSee is available at the HiSee website: <A HREF="http://hisee.sourceforge.net"> http://hisee.sourceforge.net</A>. </FONT></P><P align="center"><FONT size="5"> <img src="../Pics/Gauges.gif" width="299" height="267"></FONT></P><P align="center">&nbsp;</P><P align="left">This gauge represents the states (patterns of activity across  the nodes of the network) that have occurred in a network with 40 neurons.  Each green dot corresponds to one of those states. The red dot represents the  current state. For the most part, points that are close to each other in the  gauge correspond to states that close to each other in the network's 40-dimensional  state space. </P><P align="left"><FONT size="3">W</FONT><FONT size="3">hen Simbrain is running users can add one or        more gauges windows, each of which projects some subset of the network's        state variables to two dimensions. This allows users to independently study        different aspects of the network component. For example, one gauge might        represent the activity at the input nodes of a network, another might represent        activity at the hidden nodes, another might represent the aggregate activity        of the entire network, and another might represent the changing values  of the network's weights as it learns.</FONT></P><p><FONT size="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="dots_represent"></a>What the dots represent </FONT></p><p>When a gauge is first opened, there are no dots, since no state information  has been sent to the gauge yet. With each update of the network, state information  is sent to that gauge which displays it as a dot. The latest state is represented  with a <strong><em>red  dot</em></strong>,  and past states are represented with <strong><em>green dots</em></strong>.  Thus, the set of dots that appear in the gauge window represent the set of  states that have been visited (in the subspace that gauge is associated with)  since that gauge was added. This gives us a kind of visual history of this  network's past behavior. As the network is updated (e.g., as the creature in  the world is moved), the user can watch new dots appear as new states arise.  The user can also observe which previous states are visited by watching which  green dots turn red. </p><p><FONT size="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="hisee_basics"></a>HiSee Basics</FONT></p><p>As mentioned above, the gauges themselves are instances of HiSee,which is  separately documented <a href="http://hisee.sourceforge.net/docs/HiseeDocs.html">here</a>.  Some basic commands one is likely to use in the Simbrain setting are as follows:</p><blockquote>  <p><em><strong>Compare projections</strong></em>. Comparing how a pattern of    dots (a history of states that have occurred in the relevant network subspace)    looks under different projections by using the HiSee projection drop-down    menu. When selecting &quot;Sammon&quot; be sure to press the play button    to iterate the Sammon algorithm. </p>  <p><em><strong>Save data</strong></em>. Using the File menu, save the high-dimensional    data. It will automatically be saved in the simulations/gauge directory. Note    that you will have to re-load this later (Simbrain simulation files don't currently    save Gauge data). This is useful if you spend a long time acquiring some neural    network data and want to save it for a demonstration or for analysis later.</p>  <p><em><strong>Turning each gauge on and off.</strong> </em>The <img src="../Pics/GaugeOn.gif" width="18" height="18"> button      on each gauge (not to be confused with the similar looking <img src="../Pics/Gauge.gif" width="18" height="18">button      in the network component) controls whether that component is accepting      data or not. Thus if a user has five gauges open, and wants to stop two      of them from receiving new data, he or she must turn those gauge's on-off      button's to off. Note that as the network is run it will still cause the      current state to show up as a red dot, even if it is turned off to new      data. </p>  <p><em><strong>Fast addition of new datapoints</strong></em>. In each gauge's    preference menu, under general preferences, one can select alternate methods    for adding new datapoints. Nearest-neighbor subspace is suggested. These can    be useful when many datapoints have accrued and the standard addition methods    are slowing down. </p>  <p><em><strong>Setting tolerance for new datapoints</strong></em>. New points are only added to a gauge    if they are considered to truly be new. This is determined by testing whether    they are within a specified distance of any old points. If thy are, they are    not added. This distance can be set in the preferences menu under &quot;new point    resolution.&quot;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><P><FONT size="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="network_subspaces"></a>Associating gauges withnetwork subspaces </FONT></P><P>We can think of the total state space of the network as being given by the  set of all possible combinations of values for the nodes and weights (these  are sometimes called activation and weight (sub)spaces, respectively). Each  gauge can be associated with a subspace of this total state space. Hence,  each selectable screen item in the network component can be associated with  one dimension in a gauge window. </P><P>Associating gauges with network subspaces is    a two part process. First, a gauge must be added. Second, that gauge must  be associated with a specific subspace. </P><P><em><strong>Adding a gauge window<br></strong></em><FONT size="3">There are two    ways to add a gauge window. Users can either click on the gauge button, <IMG SRC="../Pics/Gauge.gif" WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="18">,      on the tool bar of the network component or they can select "Add Gauge" from      the gauges menu in the network component. Each gauge window is assigned      a name in the order in which it is added <EM> e.g. </EM> Gauge 1, Gauge      2, etc. </FONT></P><P><em><strong>Selecting a subspace<br>  </strong></em>By default a gauge represents the &quot;activation subspace&quot; of  the network, which corresponds to the set of possible patterns of activity  across its nodes. Hence, a 40-node network is associated, by default, with  a 40-dimensional activation space. A 6-node network is associated with a 6-dimensional  activation space. However, the user can associate any arbitrary subspace of  the total state space of the network with a gauge. </P><P><FONT size="3">To do so,  users first <a href="Network.html#SelectingItems">selects</a> those    screen items whose values (activation value for nodes, weight strength for    weights) he or she wants to gauge. The </FONT><FONT size="3"> desired     nodes and /or weights should each now be surrounded by a green selection    box. The user can now click on the <a href="Network.html#GaugesMenu">gauges    menu</a> in the network component and points the cursor to the "Set        Gauges" menu    item. A drop-down menu such as this:</FONT></P><P align="center"><img src="../Pics/menu_gauge.gif" width="194" height="99"></P><P><FONT size="3">will appear which contains a list of the gauge windows that    have been added. To complete the setting of a gauge select one of the gauge    windows from the drop-down menu. This window will then gauge that portion    of the network component that has been lassoed.</FONT></P><P><font size="3"><em><strong>An example<br></strong></em>For    example, suppose you want Gauge 1 to represent activity at the input nodesof the network below. You first <a href="Network.html#SelectingItems">select</a> the input nodes of the network, as follows: </font></P><P align="center"><FONT size="5">  <img src="../Pics/NetSelectedItems.gif" width="448" height="450"></FONT></P><P align="left">Select &quot;Gauge 1&quot; from the Gauges menu, and Gauge 1  will now capture the activity of the input nodes of this network. </P><P>&nbsp;</P><p>&nbsp;</p></BODY></HTML>
