The   colored circles with numbers in the middle represent  simplified neurons or &quot;nodes&quot; [<a href="#Note0">0</a>] . The lines between nodes represent  synaptic connections between neurons which direct the flow of activity  in the network. The smaller blue and red discs at the ends  of these lines represent synaptic connections. </p><p align="center"><img src="../Pics/simple_net.gif" width="275" height="206"></p><p>Red nodes represent &quot;excited&quot; neurons, white nodes represent inactiveneurons, blue nodes represent &quot;inhibited&quot; neurons. The numbers insidethe neurons represent their &quot;activation level&quot; (we can think of theabsolute value of this number as representing the rate of a firing of aneuron). Red weights represent excitatory synaptic connections, blue weightsrepresent inhibitory synaptic connections. The diameter of the discs representtheir strength (all of the weights above have the same absolute value). Activationflows along the connections in the direction of the discs. Activation flows fromleft to right in the network above. Since this network is not connected to theworld component (it has no <a href="#input_output">input  or output nodes</a>),  to experiment with this network a user would normally adjust the activation  of the left-most nodes by hand (see <a href="#manual_adjust">manual adjustment  of neurons and weights</a>), and then use the single step key <img src="../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> toiterate the network (applying the <a href="#update_cycle">network update algorithm)</a>.</p><p>To experiment with the network above, open the file &quot;3-1.net&quot; in  the &quot;simple&quot; directory using the open command in the <a href="#NetworkMenu">network  menu</a>. The network  works as follows. The three neurons on the  left can be <a href="#Preferences">manually adjusted</a> by the user and their  output strengths are identical to their activation levels. The activation of  the neuron in the middle is the sum of the products of the output signals of  the left-most neurons with their corresponding weights. The blue weight has  a strength of -1, and the red weights have strength of 1. Thus the activation  of the middle node, &quot;1&quot;, is given by &quot;(1 x -1) + (-1 x 1) + (3 x 1) = 1&quot;. The  middle node will only send a signal to the right-most neuron if its activation  level is 2 or more, hence it does not fire in this case, and the right-most  neuron is inactive. </p><p>Simbrain can be used to create a wide variety of neural networks, by creating  and connecting nodes (see <a href="#building_nets">building networks</a>) and  by setting the properties of individual nodes and weights (see <a href="#Preferences">preferences</a>).  Users are advised to consult a reference to neural networks, such as <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/NNcourse/">this  one</a>,on the web, for more general information on how neural networks work.</p><p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="quick_ref" id="quick_ref"></a>Quick    Reference</font></p><blockquote>  <p><em><strong>Run the network </strong></em>: Use the <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> button    to run the network, and the <img src="../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> button    (or the &quot;space&quot; bar on the keyboard) to single-step the network.    For more click <a href="#update_cycle">here</a>. </p>  <p><em><strong>Create neurons</strong></em>: Press the <img src="../Pics/New.gif" width="18" height="18">button    or press &quot;N&quot;.

A sample network sits passively  before the user. When the user &quot;runs&quot; the network it comes to life--an <a href="#update_cycle">update  algorithm </a>is repeatedly called, which is visible in the form of spreading  activity in network's nodes and (if learning is activated) changing weight  sizes. The network can be run in any of the following ways: </p><blockquote>  <p>1. Press the play button <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> in    the tool-bar to repeatedly iterate the network. Note that the image on the    button becomes that of a &quot;stop&quot; button <img src="../Pics/Stop.gif" width="18" height="18">.    Pressing this button will stop the network. Thus the play/stop button acts    as a toggle switch. </p>  <p>2. Press the step button <img src="../Pics/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> or    press &quot;space&quot; or &quot;s&quot; in the keyboard to iterate the network    a single time. Sometimes repeatedly hitting the space bar is useful way to    test a network. (Note that &quot;s&quot; is special in that it overrides the <a href="#net_world_interaction">network-world    interaction</a> button and only updates the network).</p>  <p>3. Move the creature in the <a href="World.html">world</a> component (assuming<a href="#net_world_interaction">network-world    interaction</a>    is set to both-ways or world-to-network.   </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="update_cycle"></a>Network  Update Algorithm </font></p><p>Each time the network is updated the following sixprocedures are invoked:</p><blockquote>  <p>1. A set of values is sent to the <a href="#input_output">input nodes</a> of    the network based on the position of the creature in the <a href="World.html">world</a>.    (Or, if <a href="#net_world_interaction">nework-world interaction</a> is    turned off, one can <a href="#manual_adjust">manually    adjust</a> the input    nodes) </p>  <p>2. The network is updated by going through the nodes and updating each one    [<a href="#Note1">1</a>].    The  node currently being updated can be thought of as a &quot;target&quot; node;    the nodes which connect to it can be thought of as &quot;source nodes.&quot; Each    target node is updated as follows: </p>  <blockquote>    <p>2.1 The signals being sent to it are determined. These      signals are provided by the output functions of source nodes. Output functions      produce an output signal based on the activation level of a node. There      are a variety of output functions available to each node. which are documented      in         the node-<a href="#Preferences">preferences</a> dialog box. The simplest        output function is the identity function, which simply outputs the activation        level as is. Another common output function is a threshold function,        in which case a node will only produce an output, if its activation is        above some specified level. <em>Note</em>: Output signals are not visible        in the GUI; only activation levels and weight strengths are visible. </p>    <p>2.2 That node's activation function is called. This function updates the      activation level of a target node based on signals arriving from source      nodes, and the weights connecting source nodes to the target node. Again      there are a variety of activation functions available. A common activation      function is a linear function which forms a weighted sum from incoming      signals and weight values. Documentation on each activation function can      be found directly in the node-<a href="#Preferences">preferences</a> dialog        box. The activation of a node is visible in the GUI as color and it is      printed as text. Activation values are also sent to the <a href="Gauge.html">gauges</a>      [<a href="#Note2">2</a>].</p>  </blockquote>  <p>3. Each weight's update function is called. As with nodes, the order in    which these functions are called does not matter. Documentation on each learning    function can be found directly in the weight-preferences dialog box .</p>  <p>4. A decay function is called for each node, which pushes the activation    of that node towards zero by a factor equal to the value of the variable &quot;decay,&quot; which    can be set separately for each node. If decay is set to 0, the node will    not decay.    Note: if you want the node to decay to a non-zero value, you can set a bias    level for that node, and it will decay towards that value. </p>  <p>5. The bounds of each node are checked. If the node's activation is out    of its bounds (upper and lower bounds for each node can be set separately),    then it is set to the nearest bound. This amounts to clipping the activation    value at its upper or lower bounds.</p>  <p>6. Round each node's activation level to the degree of precision selected    by the user. For example, if &quot;2&quot; is selected, then activation values    are rounded off to the nearest hundredth. Note that currently precision is    set for the entire network. In the next release, it will be possible to set    different precisions for different nodes.</p>  <p>7.

Networks  of any topology can be designed, and each node can be  customized to operate  in a specific way. Network  editing in Simbrain is modeled on a familiar &quot;draw&quot; interface  which involves creating screen elements, copying, and pasting.</p><blockquote>  <p><em><strong>Creating nodes</strong>. </em>Nodes are created by pressing &quot;N&quot; or    by pressing the <img src="../Pics/New.gif" width="18" height="18"> button    in the toolbar. </p>  <p><em><strong>Connecting nodes</strong>: </em>To create connections    <a href="#SelectingItems">select</a> one    or more &quot;source&quot; nodes, then point the cursor at a target node, and either: </p>  <blockquote>    <p> (1) Hold down the &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;option&quot; keys simultaneously      and left-click, or <br>      (2) Right-click and select &quot;connect nodes&quot; from the <a href="#popups">pop-up      menu</a>. </p>  </blockquote>  <p>To quickly connect one group of neurons to another,    select all the source neurons, and while holding down &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;option&quot;  left-click on the target neurons one by one. </p>  <p><em><strong>Selecting nodes.</strong> </em>Selecting neurons and nodes is    important.

Simulations can be opened or  saved via the <a href="#simulation_menu">simulation menu</a>. Future versions  of simbrain will feature an enhanced simulation structure, allowing for arbitrarily  many networks, worlds, and gauges, and for more fine-tuned setting of their  interactions. </p><p>Simulation files are saved in the Simbrain/simulations/sims directory. They  contain, in order, a path to a stored network file, and a path to a storedenvironment file, relative to the Simbrain directory itself. For example:</p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="10">  <tr>    <td><blockquote>        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/simulations/networks/feedforward/FF-4-2.net<br>          /simulations/worlds/simple2.wld</font></p>    </blockquote></td>  </tr></table><p>Note that file separators are stored as forward slashes even on Windowsmachines. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notes</font></p><p><a name="Note0"></a>0.This document,&quot;neuron&quot; and &quot;node&quot; are  used interchangeably, and to lesser extent, so are &quot;weight&quot; and &quot;synapse.&quot; Of  course in, Simbrain, as in all connectionist models, the &quot;neurons&quot; and &quot;synapses&quot; are  highly idealized.</p><p><a name="Note1"></a>1. As the nodes are being updated  the new states are stored in a buffer until all nodes are updated. Thus, it  does not matter which order the nodes are updated. </p><p><a name="Note2" id="Note2"></a>2. The distinction between output    and activation functions will be eliminated in the next release, as the neuralnetwork component is redesigned.</p><p><a name="Note3" id="Note3"></a>3. A single diagonal movement is produced by  one horizontal and one vertical movement. Hence  when the creature moves  one  step diagonally it travels slightly farther than  when it moves one step horizontally or vertically. </p><blockquote>  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p></p></blockquote></body></html>
