<p>The creature in the world can be moved by the network. Each time the network is updated (e.g. when the network is run using the <img src="../../../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> button), the commands associated with those output nodes whose activity is above zero are issued. Thus, if a network has an <a href="../../Network/prefs/inoutnodes.html">output node</a> associated with the motor command &quot;North&quot;, then as long as that node is active above zero the creature will move north. </p>
<p>The creature in Simbrain doesn't do anything very interesting right now, mainly because the world component has been used thus far to study perception, not sensorimotor integration or control. Improvements to the motor dimension of Simbrain are coming, though not for several releases, so please contact the developers if you are interested in working in this area. </p>

<p><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Sensory stimulation overview </FONT></p>
<P>In general, sensory stimulation is modeled in Simbrain by simulating the impact an environment will have on the creature's sensory receptors. In particular, the world component constructs a <em></em><strong><em>proximal stimulus</em>,</strong> <em><strong>receptor vector</strong>,</em> or <em><strong>input vector</strong></em> (all three phrases are synonymous in Simbrain) based on a number of factors, including the relative position of the creature and the objects and the values associated with the different objects. Each object in the world component is associated with an <em><strong>object vector</strong></em>, or <em><strong>distal stimulus</strong></em> value. Roughly speaking (details below), the world creates a proximal stimulus from a set of distal stimuli.The input vector that is thereby created is a vector of values which are sent to the neural network's <a href="../../Network/prefs/inoutnodes.html">input nodes</a>, each of which is associated with some component of this vector via a <em><strong>sensory index</strong> </em>. The world component thereby produces patterns of activity across the sensory &quot;receptors&quot; of the creature's neural network. For example, if the world produces an input vector of the following form,</P>
<P align="center"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">5, 0, 1, 1, 5</font></P>
<P>then an input node with sensory index 1 will receive the value 5, an input node with sensory index 2 will receive the value 0, etc.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">The icon for the creature is the white mouse (note that even though there is only one type of icon for the creature other types organisms can be modeled in Simbrain--not just white mice). There are currently six different icons for representing the objects that can exist in the world--blue cheese, gouda, swiss, decaying fish, flower blossoms, and pink flower blossoms. These icons are merely symbols and don't necessarily indicate the properties the user selects for the objects. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"> The icons for the creature and the objects have been chosen to suggest the sense modality of smell. In the real world the sense of smell is the sense of particular chemicals which make their way into an animal's nose. Chemicals are released into the air by various objects and once a chemical is airborne it tends to diffuse away from the object producing it. The further away from an object an animal is the harder it is for the animal to smell the object. Some animals have a much better sense of smell than others and some objects produce a stronger odor than others. The question of whether an animal will smell an object depends on how sensitive the animal's sense of smell is, how much of an odor the object is producing, and how far apart the animal and object are. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"> The world component includes a representation of the different factors that are involved in sensory processes. The settings that the user selects in the entity dialog box control both the proximal stimulation (the stimulation experienced by the creature) and the distal stimulation (the stimulus produced by the object). Once the user has selected the properties they would like the creature and the objects to have the inputs that are sent to the network component are determined by the position of the creature in relation to the objects. Generally the further apart the creature and an object are from each other the smaller the input generated by the world component is. Simbrain is constructed so that other kinds of virtual worlds (involving sight, sound, and multi-modal sensory combinations) can easily be added. </FONT></P>
