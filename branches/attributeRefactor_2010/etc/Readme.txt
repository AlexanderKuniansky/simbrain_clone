SIMBRAIN 3 ALPHA 1

This is a first alpha verision of Simbrain 3, a major refactoring and revision of Simbrain 2, with hundreds of new features.   It is mostly functional, and serves to illustrate the overall design.  However, the documentation is incomplete (most of the hundreds of features are not yet documented!), there are numerous minor bugs and absent features (e.g. supervised learning).   More refactoring is also planned.
