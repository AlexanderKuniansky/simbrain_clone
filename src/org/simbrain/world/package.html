The <b>world</b> package contains the world component, which provides an environment for the creature to interact with. Simulated 'sensory inputs' are fed to the network based on where it is in this environment and what objects (cheese and flowers) are in its vicinity. 'Motor output' from the network is expressed as movement in the world's two dimensional space.  Plans are to separate the world component out as a separate package and to make it possible to describe arbitrarily many kinds of environment according to an interface</body>
