The <b>network</b> package contains representation of neural networks.  High
level abstract classes are contained in the interfaces package.  Specific network,
neuron, and synapse descriptions are contained in those packages.

<b>Overview</b>

The model neural network is essentially a graph, a collection of nodes connected by vertices
(the vertices are neurons and the connections are synapses).  Each node and vertex is an object.
he whole network has three lists, a list of nodes,  a list of connections, and a list of networks ("subnetworks").   
The connections have references to the source and target nodes they connect. When a network is updated the program goes  through 
the list of neurons and call an update function internal to each one, and similarly with the list of synapses.
Buffers are used so that the whole network can be updated synchronously. 

<b>Subnetworks</b>
Subnetworks (networks within networks) are themselves network objects, with lists of neurons and nodes, and perhaps additional subnetworks.
 Subnetworks are used when special rules are required that go beyond what is available locally to the node and connection objects, so that 
 the update method above won't work.  For example, some networks must have their nodes updated in a special order.   
 When subnetworks are updated  the "update" method is overridden to capture these special rules.

Connections can exist between any two nodes, at whatever level of the subnetwork hierarchy. 
Overall, a whole network, including subnetworks, is just a graph.  The subnetworks only serve to  allow for custom updating.
Special methods are available to any network--getFlatNeuronList and getFlatSynapseList--which collect all the neurons or synapses 
of all subnetworks and return them as one large list. 

When the top-level network is updated, its nodes and connections are updated, as are its subnetworks.  
When these subnetworks are updated the process is repeated.
