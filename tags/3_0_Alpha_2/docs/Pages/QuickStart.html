You should see a few networks show up. You can move them around however you like, maximize and minimize them. </p>  <p class="heading">Add neurons to a network </p>  <p>Click in one of the networks you created. Now create some neurons, by presing the <img src="../Images/AddNeuron.png" width="18" height="18" /> button or using the &quot;P&quot; key (shown here as upper-case; however to use it, use lower case). Do this a few times to create a line of neurons. </p>  <p class="heading">Select  those neurons </p>  <p></p>  <p>Use the mouse the draw a lasso around the neurons so that they are selected. You can also press the &quot;N&quot; button to select all neurons. Green halos will show up around these neurons signifying that you have selected them. </p>  <p class="heading">Randomize the neurons </p>  <p>With the neurons selected, press the randomize button <img src="../Images/Rand.png" width="18" height="18" /> or pressing &quot;r&quot;.  Do this a few times to get a sense of what happens when neurons are randomized. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Copy and paste some   neurons </span></p>  <p>Select some neurons, copy them using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Copy</span> (or control/command-C), click where you want to put a copy of those neurons, and then paste them there using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Paste</span> (or control/command-V). Press paste repeatedly to see multiple copies of these neurons appear. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Delete neurons </span></p>  <p>Select all your neurons, and press the delete button <img src="../Images/DeleteNeuron.png" width="18" height="18" /> or the &quot;backspace&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; key. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Connect one  neuron to another </span></p>  <p>1) Create two neurons. You will make a connection from a &quot;source&quot; to a &quot;target&quot; neuron. </p>  <p>2) Select the source neuron. Designate it a source neuron by selecting <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Set source neuron(s)</span> or pressing the &quot;1&quot; key, which is a shortcut for selecting source neurons. Observe the red halo that appears around the neuron.</p>  <p>3) Select the target neuron.</p>  <p>4) Connect the source to the target neuron using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Connect Source-Target &gt; All to all</span> or by pressing the &quot;2&quot; key. (After a while you can get quick at selecting, and using the &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; keys to connect neurons).</p>  <p>5) If you like, clear the &quot;source neuron&quot; halo by going to <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Clear source neuron(s)</span></p>  <p><span class="heading">Add activation to  one neuron </span></p>  <p>Select the source neuron from above. Press the &quot;up&quot; arrow button, and observe the value of the neuron change upwards.</p>  <p><span class="heading">Iterate a network </span></p>  <p>Iterate the network once. This can be done by clicking the <img src="../Images/Step.gif" width="18" height="18" /> button in the desktop toolbar, or pressing the space-bar in the network (these are slightly different operations, but we can ignore the distinction for now). </p>  <p>Observe activation pass from the source to the target neuron. Iterate again and the activation clears out.</p>  <p><span class="heading">Select and randomize the weight </span> </p>  <p></p>  <p>Select the weight you created by clicking on it. If that is tricky, lasso over the connection line. You can also press &quot;w&quot;, which selects all weights. A green halo will show up around the weight.</p>  <p>As with neurons, randomize by  pressing the randomize button <img src="../Images/Rand.png" width="18" height="18" /> or pressing &quot;r&quot;. Do this a few times to get a sense of what happens when synapses are randomized. If they are positive their color is red; if negative blue. The size of the weight is proportional the strength of the synapse.</p>  <p>Having randomized this weight, again add activation to the source neuron and iterate the network, to see that the activation propagates differently. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Make a layered network </span></p>  <p>Let's make a new network. Delete everything you've done up until now.</p>  <p>1. Make a row of neurons by pressing &quot;P&quot; a few times.</p>  <p>2. Copy and paste those neurons and move them right above the first neurons.</p>  <p>3. Repeat. You should now have three rows or &quot;layers&quot; of neurons.</p>  <p>4. Select the bottom row and make them source neurons using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Set source neuron(s)</span> or by pressing the &quot;1&quot; key.</p>  <p>5. Select the middle row and connect   using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Connect Source-Target &gt; All to all</span> or by pressing the &quot;2&quot; key. </p>  <p>6. Now immediately make the middle row the new source neurons by pressing &quot;1&quot; while they are still selected</p>  <p>7. Select the final row and press &quot;2&quot; to connect.</p>  <p>8. Activate the bottom row by selecting those neurons and pressing the &quot;R&quot; button to randomize them.</p>  <p>9.Iterate the network a few times pressing the space-bar, to see activation propoagate through the network</p>  <p><span class="heading">Make a recurrent network </span></p>  <p></p>  <p>1. Make a grid of neurons using Insert &gt; Add Neurons... A dialog will show up asking you how many neurons you want to create. Say 9 and press OK.</p>  <p>2. Select all the neurons with &quot;N&quot;</p>  <p>3. Connect them all to themselves using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Connect Self &gt; All to all.</span></p>  <p>4. Randomize the weights by first pressing &quot;W&quot; to select all weights, and then pressing &quot;R&quot; to randomize them.</p>  <p>5. Randomize the neurons by first pressing &quot;N&quot; to select all neurons, and then pressing &quot;R&quot; to randomize them.</p>  <p>6. Iterate the network using the spacebar. Observe the changing behavior. Periodically re-randomize the neurons using &quot;N&quot; followed by &quot;R&quot;. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Edit a few neurons </span></p>  <p>1. Select all the weights in your network by pressing &quot;W&quot; or using <span class="command">Select &gt; Edit Selected Neurons</span></p>  <p>2. Double click one of the neurons, or use <span class="command">Edit &gt; Edit Selected Neurons</span>. A neuron dialog will show up allowing you to edit these neurons. Change the update rule to <span class="command">Clamped</span>. </p>  <p>3. Randomize the network and iterate it, and observe that the neurons whose update rule is clamped do not change.</p>  <p><span class="heading">Edit  weights</span></p>  <p>1. Select all the weights in your network by pressing &quot;W&quot; or using <span class="command">Select &gt; Select All Weights. </span></p>  <p>2. Double click one of the synapses, or use <span class="command">Edit &gt; Edit Selected Synapse(s)</span>. A synapse dialog will show up allowing you to edit these weights. Change the learning rule to <span class="command">Hebbian</span>. </p>  <p>3. Randomize everything by using<span class="command"> Select &gt; Select All </span>or pressing &quot;A&quot; or command-A, and then pressing &quot;R&quot; (this randomizes weights and neurons).</p>  <p>4. Press the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" width="18" height="18" />. Periodicaly press &quot;A&quot; then &quot;R&quot; to re-randomize the network. Notice that the weights slowly change their size, becuse they are learning using the Hebb rule. </p>  <p><span class="heading">Create a bar chart </span></p>  <p>Don't delete the network you just created. We will now graph its activity using a bar chart. </p>  <p>1. Add a bar chart to the workspace using <span class="command">Desktop Menu: Insert &gt; New Plot &gt; Bar Chart</span>.</p>  <p>2. Connect the network to the bar-chart <span class="command">Network Menu: Couple &gt; BarChart1</span>. </p>  <p>3. Iterate the workspace a few times the step button <img src="../Images/Step.gif" width="18" height="18" /> , or run the workspace using the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" width="18" height="18" />. While it's running periodically reset the network using select all and randomize (&quot;A&quot; then &quot;R&quot; while the network component is in focus), and observe the changing pattern in the bar graph. </p>  <p class="heading">&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div></div></body></html>
