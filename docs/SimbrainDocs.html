<p>Simbrain is a tool for building artificial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>
that has been developed with the <a href="Pages/Design.html">philosophy</a>
of ease-of-use and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch
Simbrain and experiment. For in-depth documentation on each Simbrain
component, follow the links below. Simbrain is open source and uses the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU license</a>.</p>
<p>For a guided dive directly into Simbrain, try this <a href="Pages/QuickStart.html">quickstart</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, here are some <a href="Pages/Examples.html">examples</a> which show how to do specific things in Simbrain.<br />

<h1><a href="Pages/Workspace.html">Workspace
</a></h1>
<p>The Simbrain workspace is the encompassing framework which contains
all simulation components (networks, worlds, etc.), as well as
mechanisms for connecting them together via "couplings", scripting,
etc. Other general topics concerning simbrain simulations. </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a href="Pages/Network.html">Networks</a></h1>
<p>The network component of Simbrain represents a simulated neural
circuit. Networks are the core component of a Simbrain simulation. They
are built using a simple graphical interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a href="Pages/World.html">Worlds</a></h1>
<p>Worlds are components that interact with Network components by
giving and/or receiving information. The "OdorWorld" shown to the right
simulates a creature's ability to move and smell in a simple
two-dimensional world.</p>

Plots and Time Series. </p>
