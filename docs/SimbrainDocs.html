	<p><strong>Simbrain is a tool</strong> for simulating neural networks (simulated brain  circuits). Simbrain aims to be as easy-to-use and as self-explanatory  as possible. There is much you can accomplish by experimentation (that  is, without these docs!). When Simbrain is launched a workspace is  opened, within which various components can be created and linked  together. For documentation on each component, click below, or try this <a href="Pages/QuickStart.html"> quickstart.</a> Click <a href="Pages/Design.html">here</a> for              more on the design philosophy of Simbrain. Simbrain is open source and uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU license</a>.</p>

  <h1><a href="Pages/Workspace.html">Workspace</a></h1>
  <p>The workspace component of Simbrain contains all the simulation components: networks, worlds, and gauges. These components can be added and connected in various ways, and their total configuration can be saved. Each workspace can be though of as an individual experiment in how neural networks work. </p>

		<p>Worlds are components which produce inputs to and/or accept inputs from network components. The &quot;OdorWorld&quot; shown here simulates smell inputs and motor outputs of a creature in a virtual world.</p>

		<p>The states that occur in a neural network correspond to points in a high dimensional space. These states and the patterns they form can be visually inspected using the gauge components, which are based on HiSee, a tool for projecting high-</p>
