<p class="heading">Run a simulation</p>
<p>When Simbrain launches, simply
    press play <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> in the network
  toolbar and observe activity propagating through the network and the creature
    moving. Open different workspaces using <span class="command">File &gt; Open Workspace</span> and
  press play in the network windows  to see what happens. </p>
<p class="heading">Manually
  moving  objects  in  Worlds</p>
<p>Open the simulation attract.xml. Clikc the play button then move the object in the world around and observe the creature in the world chasing after it. Now try repulse.xml. </p>
<p class="heading">Finding stable states</p>
<p>Open the workspace lessons &gt; iac.xml. While in the network component, select all nodes with &quot;N&quot;,  press &quot;R&quot; to
    randomize the nodes and press the space bar a few times to update the network
    until it settles into a stable state (that is, until the nodes don't change
    when you press space). Repeat; press &quot;R&quot; and &quot;space,
  space,space&quot; repeatedly
  until the net settles in a stable state, then &quot;R&quot; and &quot;space,
  space, space.&quot; again,
etc. In this way get a sense of the stable states of that network.</p>
<span class="heading">Build a network</span>
<p>Open a new network window and create a few neurons using the <img src="../Pics/New.gif" width="18" height="18"> button.
  Then connect them as
described <a href="Network/buildingnets.html">here</a>. Then run the network. Or, create a network of a specific type using <span class="command">Network &gt; New Network &gt; ... </span> Just press OK if a dialog box appears. and see how it behaves when you press run. You can connect this network to a world by selecting <span class="command">Workspace &gt; New World </span>and then right clicking on neurons and selecting <span class="command">Sensors &gt; ... </span>and <span class="command">Motor Commands ...</span> from the popup menu. </p>
<p class="heading">Study network parameters</p>
<p>Select all nodes with &quot;N&quot;,
  then double-click on a node. Change it's decay value, activation function,
  etc. Then move the creature around a bit (by left dragging) to see how network
  dynamics have changed.</p>
<p class="heading">Study learning</p>
<p>Select all weights with &quot;W&quot;, then double-click
  on a weight. Change it's learning rule or other parameters. Then run the network and see whether the weights change size. </p>
<p class="heading">Use Gauges</p>
<p>Open a gauge by pressing the add
  gauge <img src="../Pics/Gauge.gif" width="18" height="18"> button and
  open any workspace. If there is an odor world drag the creature around the different objects and watch the patterns that
  emerge in the gauge. Try opening different worlds and gauges and seeing what
  patterns show up in the gauge. When a pattern has developed for a period of
  time, switch the gauge projection chooser from &quot;coordinate&quot; to &quot;PCA&quot; and
  from &quot;PCA&quot; to &quot;Sammon.&quot; When
  it is in Sammon press the <img src="../Pics/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> play
button inside that gauge to see what patterns emerge. </p>
