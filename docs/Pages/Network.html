	</p><h1>Network</h1>
	
	<p>Networks
are built by creating neurons and connecting them with synapses. They
are run by pressing the "play" or "step" buttons. (See the <a href="Network/quickref.html">quick reference</a>).</p>
	
	<p>There are a variety of different <a href="Network/neuron.html">neurons</a> and <a href="Network/synapse.html">synapses</a>,
each with their own rules and parameters. By combining these together
you can create indefinitely many different kinds of networks. There are
also special types of networks called "<a href="Network/subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a>"
which can be added to a simulation. Different subnetworks can be linked
together, leading to even more complex and powerful simulations.</p>
<p>There are also connection objects, layout objects, model groups and other functions which can be used to build neural networks.<br>
</p>

	<p>Shown
below is a simple neural network. The colored circles with numbers in
the middle represent simplified neurons or "nodes." The lines between
nodes represent synaptic connections between neurons which direct the
flow of activity in the network. The smaller blue and red discs at the
ends of these lines represent synaptic connections. </p>

	<p align="left"><a name="RunningNet"></a>When
Simbrain is first opened nothing happens. A sample network sits
passively before the user. When the user "runs" the network it comes to
life--an <a href="Network/network_op.html">update algorithm</a> is
repeatedly called, which is visible in the form of spreading activity
in network's nodes and (if learning is activated) changing weight
sizes. The network can be run by pressing pressing the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18"> in the tool-bar to repeatedly iterate the network. Note that the image on the button becomes that of a "stop" button <img src="../Images/Stop.gif" height="18" width="18">.
Pressing this button will stop the network. Thus the play/stop button
acts as a toggle switch. You can also press the step button <img src="../Images/Step.gif" height="18" width="18">
(or press "space") to iterate the network a single time. Sometimes
repeatedly hitting the space bar is useful way to test a network.</p>

    <p>Quick reference for meanings of colors, etc. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Zero neuron </strong>: a neuron with a value of 0 represents a <em>non-</em>active
neuron, which is either not firing or is firing at a very low rate. In
terms of voltages, this can be thought of as a neuron which is at its <em>resting potential</em>,
that is, which has its baseline electrical charge, which is actually
typically around -70mV (millivolts). In Simbrain this corresponds to
the color 0. </p>
    <p><strong>Positive activation</strong>: a
neuron with positive activation can be thought of as firing at above
its normal rate. In terms of voltages, this can be thought of as a
neuron which is <em>above</em> its resting potential, e.g. -50mV. Such
a neuron is sometimes said to be "excited" or "depolarized." In
Simbrain this corresponds to a shade of red by default. </p>
    <p><strong>Negative activation</strong>:
it is hard to say what a neuron with negative activation corresponds to
in terms of firing rates. In terms of voltages, this can be thought of
as a neuron which is <em>below</em> its resting potential, e.g. -50mV.
Such a neuron is sometimes said to be "inhibited" or "hyperpolarized."
In Simbrain this corresponds to a shade of blue by default. </p>
    <p><strong>Excitatory synapse</strong>:
a weight with a positive value corresponds to an excitatory synapse.
When these synapses are activated the post-synaptic neuron is <em>more</em>
likely to fire, they "heat things up," as it were. An excitatory
synapse is one which releases excitatory neurotransmitters, which bind
to channels post-synaptically which cause currents that lead to an
increase in the post-synaptic voltage potential. AMPA synapses are a
common type of excitatory synapse. Excitatory synapses are shown as red
discs in Simbrain. </p>
    <p><strong>Inhibitory synapse</strong>: a
weight with a negative value corresponds to an inhibitory synapse. When
these synapses are activated the post-synaptic neuron is <em>less</em>
likely to fire, they "cool things down," as it were. An inhibitory
synapse is one which releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, which bind
to channels post-synaptically which cause currents that lead to a
decrease in the post-synaptic voltage potential. GABA synapses are a
common type of inhibitory synapse. Inhibitory synapses are shown as
blue discs in Simbrain.</p>
    <p><strong>Zero synapse</strong>: a weight with a value of 0 is a way of mathematically representing the <em>absence of</em> a connection. In Simbrain this is currently represented as blue, inhibitory. </p>
    <p><strong>Net input </strong>:
the net input to a neuron represents, roughly, the summation of
excitatory and inhibitory signals, from excitatory and inhibitory
synapses, at the cell body. </p>
    <p><strong>Bias</strong>: the bias of a neuron can be thought as its base-line firing rate or its resting potential.</p>
    <p><strong>Clipping / Upper and Lower Bounds</strong>: There are upper and lower limits on the firing rate (in hertz) or voltage potential (in mV) of a neuron.</p><span class="heading"><br>

  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confusion about clamping</span>:
The word "clamped" gets used both as a name for a kind of synapse and
neuron update, and for the buttons in the toolbar, but the meaning is
slightly different.&nbsp; The toolbar buttons are a kind of temporary
override, while the update rules are permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you
understand the distinction but I think I saw this come up somewhere so
I thought I'd mention it. Clamped for neurons is useful mainly when it
is input neurons that the user will manually set&nbsp; themselves. /
