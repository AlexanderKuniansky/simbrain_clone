	<h1>Network</h1>
	
	<p>Networks are built by creating neurons and connecting them with synapses. They are run by pressing the &quot;play&quot; or &quot;step&quot; buttons. There are many varieties of neurons and synapses, each with their rules and parameters. By combining these together you can create indefinitely many different kinds of networks. There are also special types of networks called &quot;subnetworks&quot; which can be added. Different subnetworks can be linked together, leading to even more complex and powerful siulations.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This page describes the basic visual elements of the networks and what they signify, and how to run the networks. Details on the different neuron types and settings are provided via the links in the content box. </p>
	<p><br>
      <span class="heading">Example</span>	</p>
	<p>Shown below is a simple neural network. The colored circles with numbers in the middle represent simplified neurons or &quot;nodes.&quot; The lines between nodes represent synaptic connections between neurons which direct the flow of activity in the network. The smaller blue and red discs at the ends of these lines represent synaptic connections. </p>

	<p align="left">Activation flows along the connections in the direction of the weights. Activation flows from left to right in the network above. </p>

	  <p class="heading">Running the Network </p>
	  <p>When Simbrain is first opened nothing happens. A sample network sits passively before the user. When the user &quot;runs&quot; the network it comes to life--an <a href="network_op.html">update algorithm </a>is repeatedly called, which is visible in the form of spreading activity in network's nodes and (if learning is activated) changing weight sizes. The network can be run in any of the following ways: </p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p class="heading2">Run the network</p>
	    <p>Press the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" width="18" height="18"> in the tool-bar to repeatedly iterate the network. Note that the image on the button becomes that of a &quot;stop&quot; button <img src="../Images/Stop.gif" width="18" height="18">. Pressing this button will stop the network. Thus the play/stop button acts as a toggle switch. </p>
	    <p class="heading2">Step the network </p>
	    <p>Press the step button <img src="../Images/Step.gif" width="18" height="18"> or press &quot;space&quot; or &quot;s&quot; in the keyboard to iterate the network a single time. Sometimes repeatedly hitting the space bar is useful way to test a network. (Note that &quot;s&quot; is special in that it overrides the <a href="networldbutton.html">network-world interaction</a> button and only updates the network).</p>
	    <p><span class="heading2">World-based iteration</span> </p>
	    <p>The network will also run if an appropriate action is taken in one of the open and coupled worlds (assuming<a href="networldbutton.html"> network-world interaction</a> is set to both-ways or world-to-network). For example, moving a creature in an <a href="../Worlds/OdorWorld/OdorWorld.html">OdorWorld</a> will update all connected networks. </p>
