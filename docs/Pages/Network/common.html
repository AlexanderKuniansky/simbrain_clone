  <p><span class="heading"><a name="clipping"></a>Clipping</span></p>
<p>If a neuron or weight uses clipping, its activation value or strength is  modified as follows. If its activation value or srength is above the upper bound for that neuron or weight, it is set to that upper bound. If it is below the lower bound for that neuron or weight, it is set to that lower bound.</p>
<p class="heading"><a name="noise"></a>Noise Generator </p>
<p>Some simbrain components allow noise to be added to their value. Noise is generated using the following fields:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Distribution</span>: The probability density function that the random values follow. Currently Gaussian or uniform. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Upper bound</span>: If the distribution is uniform, this represents the upper bound of the distribution. If the distribution is Gaussian and clipping is being used, this cuts off the upper tail of the distribution. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Lower bound</span>: If the distribution is uniform, this represents the lower bound of the distribution. If the distribution is Gaussian and clipping is being used, this cuts off the lower tail of the distribution. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Mean value</span>: This is the mean of the Gaussian distribution. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Standard deviation</span>: This is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Use clipping</span>: If true, upper and lower bounds are used as described above. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading">Randomization</p>
<p>Is a uniform distribution within the upper and lower bounds of relevant components. </p>
<p class="heading"><a name="synapse" id="synapse"></a>Synapse</p>
<p>The inputs to a node can have different degrees of influence on that node. This is measured a number often called a &quot;weight.&quot; Since these are connections between &quot;neurons&quot; they are also called synapses. </p>
<p>We can talk about the presynaptic signal and postsynaptic signal or source and target neurons. </p>
<p class="heading"><a name="spiking" id="spiking"></a>Spiking Neurons</p>
<p>These neurons produce discrete &quot;firing&quot; events. </p>
<p class="heading"><a name="time"></a>Time step vs. Iteration </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The time step is a global variable which is used whenever differential equations are numerically integrated. Generally speaking, the smaller the time-step, the more accurate the numerical integration. </p>
  <p>Several neuron and synapse types are defined in terms of differential equations. We call these &quot;continuous&quot; neurons and synapses. When a continuous neuron or synapse is used, an iteration of the network represents an interval of time whose length equals the <span class="command">time-step</span>. This is indicated by the word &quot;iterations&quot; being replaced with &quot;seconds&quot; in the time-step indicator at the bottom-left of the network panel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading"><a name="wtdinput" id="wtdinput"></a>Weighted Input </p>
<p>Each input to a node can have different amounts of influence on that node. The amount of influence that an input has is called the &quot;weight&quot; of that input. We represent the weight of the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> input by <em>w</em><sub>i</sub> and the activation level from the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> node by <em>a</em><sub>i</sub>. The weighted input is then: 
<p align="center"><img src="equations/weighted.gif" width="167" height="75">
<p>Note that a sensory input term <em>I</em> is also added to the weighted input if the node has a <a href="couplings.html">sensory coupling</a> attached to it. &quot;Weighted input&quot; is also referred to as &quot;net input&quot; in much of the connectionist literature. To make a neuron whose acitvation value equals its weighted input, use a <a href="neuron/linear.html">linear neuron</a> with slope = 1 and bias = 0. </p>
