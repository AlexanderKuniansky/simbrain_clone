<p>If a neuron or weight uses clipping, its activation value or strength is  modified as follows. If its activation value or srength is above the upper bound for that neuron or weight, it is set to that upper bound. If it is below the lower bound for that neuron or weight, it is set to that lower bound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="heading"><a name="clamping" id="clamping"></a>Clamping</p>
<p>In general, a clamped synapse or node will not change over time; it is &quot;clamped&quot; to its current value. There are two ways to clamp neurons and synapses in Simbrain. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Set the type  of a synapse to <a href="synapse/clamped.html">clamped synapse</a> or the type of a neuron to <a href="neuron/clamped.html">clamped neuron</a>. This allows specific subsets of synapses or neurons to be clamped.<br> 
    </p>
  <p>(2) In the <a href="toolbar.html">Toolbar</a> or <a href="menu.html#MenuEdit">Edit menu</a>, select &quot;Clamp weights&quot; or &quot;Clamp synapses.&quot; These cause <em>all</em> weights or synapses in a simulation to be clamped. This is useful when, for example, training a hopfield network. You clamp the neurons at a value, then run the network to train the weights. Then you unclamp the neurons and clamp the weights, to test the network's memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways that clamps can be overridden. First, manually setting the properties of a component overrides the clamp, e.g. you can press the up and down arrows to adjust a clamped neuron. Second, some <a href="subnetwork.html">subnetwork</a> types train weights in a way that overrides the clamping. </p>

<p class="heading"><a name="wtdinput" id="wtdinput"></a>Weighted Input </p>
<p>Each input to a node can have different amounts of influence on that node. The amount of influence that an input has is called the &quot;weight&quot; of that input. We represent the weight of the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> input by <em>w</em><sub>i</sub> and the activation level from the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> node by <em>a</em><sub>i</sub>. The weighted input is then: 
<p align="center"><img src="equations/weighted.gif" width="167" height="75">
<p>Note that a sensory input term <em>I</em> is also added to the weighted input if the node has a <a href="couplings.html">sensory coupling</a> attached to it. </p>
<p>When a source neuron is a spiking neuron (see <a href="spikingnetworks.html">spiking networks</a>) the weight times activation term for that neuron is replaced by something more complex. See <a href="spikingnetworks.html">spiking networks</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Weighted input&quot; is also referred to as &quot;net input&quot; in much of the connectionist literature. To make a neuron whose acitvation value equals its weighted input, use a <a href="neuron/linear.html">linear neuron</a> with slope = 1 and bias = 0. </p>
