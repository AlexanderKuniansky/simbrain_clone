      <strong><em>Connect</em></strong> creates links between all selected nodes and the node that has been right clicked on.<br>
      <strong><em>Set propertie</em></strong>s: Different depending on whether you are clicked on a node or weight. If multiple nodes or weights are selected, it sets properties of that set.<br>
      <strong><em>Set network properties</em></strong>. Sets properties for the entire network, as opposed to selected items. For more click here. <br>
      <em> <strong>Set Input</strong></em>: Set the input-designation of the node that has been clicked on (does not apply to all selected nodes). <br>
      <em><strong>Set Output </strong>: </em>Set the output-designation of the node that has been clicked on (does not apply to all selected nodes). </p>
