            Synapse groups represent a unified construct allowing users to interact with the aggregated whole of all the synapses connecting two <a href="./NeuronGroup.html">Neuron Groups</a>. In very large networks, operating on synapses on an indvidual basis would be impractical; Synapse Groups offer a means by which users can manipulate all synapses with common source and target destinations. This includes things like mass manipulation of synapse properties, learning rules, and the display of synaptic strength data. Synapse groups automatically organize and separate synapses by their polarity (i.e. whether or not they are excitatory or inhibitory, as determined by the sign of their weight value). Therefore the excitatory synapses in a synapse group may be manipulated independently of the group's inhibitory synapses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pictured to the right is an example of all the different visualizations of synapse groups a user may encounter in Simbrain. Although there are different visualizations for unidirectional, bidirectional, and recurrent synapse groups, it is important to note that fundamentally they all represent the same underlying construct. By right clicking any synapse group interaction box, the user has the ability to "toggle synapse visiblity". Toggling synapse visibility either reveals each of the individual synapses constituting the group (and would look like the first image pictured to the right) if the group is currently being represented by an arrow. If the all the synapses in the group are currently visible toggling synapse visibility will remove all the individual synapse graphics from the network panel and replace them with a single green arrow. For very large synapse groups (> ~10,000) it is <b>not advisable</b> to make each indvidiual synapse visible. In such cases the connectivity structure is obscured by the sheer number of synapses, and worse, the GUI may become slow or unresponsive (depending on the machine and how many synapses are being made visible at once).

        <p class="heading">Group Properties & Editing Scope</p>
           <p> The basic information that synapse groups store and maintain on the group level and about their constituent synapses includes the following:</p>
            <blockquote>

                <p><span class="heading2">Group ID: </span>Unique labelling that identifies the group.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Label: </span>Name of group, which is editable by the user.
                </p>

                <p><span class="heading2">Population: </span>Number of synapses in the group.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Optimize As Group:</span> An advanced option for speeding up the data representation and update speed of synapse groups. When a synapse group has this option selected, it maintains prototype excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which it pulls data from in order to display information about the group. This is as opposed to iterating over every synapse in the group and checking a particular value to ensure all synapses have the same value. Similarly, when updating the synapse group, iteration over synapses of a given polarity will be skipped entirely if the prototype of that polarity indicates that the synapses of that type are <a href="../synapse.html#Frozen">frozen</a> or <a href="../synapse/Static.html">static</a>. This feature assumes that if the user is working whe synapse <b>groups</b>, then their interaction with individual synapses will be minimal. If a single synapse were to be changed independently of the synapse group's tools for doing so, those changes would not be reflected in the synapse group dialog.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Excitatory Type: </span> The type or update rule governing the excitatory synapses in the group. See the page on <a href="../synapse.html">synapses</a> for a complete listing.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Inhibitory Type: </span>TThe type or update rule governing the excitatory synapses in the group. See the page on <a href="../synapse.html">synapses</a> for a complete listing.
                </p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Parent: </span>Denotes the parent group, if any.</p>
                <p><span class="heading2">Source/Target Group: </span>The neuron group which acts as a source(target) to this synapse group. Specifically the whole of the synapses comprising this group represent the efferent(afferent) synapses of the source(target) neuron group, which connects the source group to the target group. In other words a given synapse group mediates the flow of activation between its source and target group. It should be noted that there can be no more than 1 synapse group connecting two neuron groups in a particular direction. That is, there cannot be more than one synapse group with the same source and target neuron group. </p>

            <blockquote>
                Synapse groups allow users to edit en masse the properties of the synapses that comprise the group. This includes the basic properties like delay, or bounds, but also the synapse update rule(s) and spike responder(s) and its(their) own independent properties. Since synapse groups segregate synapses by polarity, these changes can be applied to excitatory or inhibitory synapses independently. For a full listing of the properties of synapses which can be changed see the page on <a href="../synapse.html">synapses</a>. Sufficed to say, synapse groups allow you to manipulate all the synapses in the group as you would an individual synapse.

                    During creation, the user must choose which type of <a href="../connections.html">connector</a> should be used to determine how (and what) synaptic connections are made. For a full listing as well as links to the details of how each connection manager functions, see the page on <a href="connections.html">connections</a>.
                    <br> Synapse groups allow users to edit some properties of the overall connectivity structure of the synapses in the group. In some cases like <a href="../connections/sparse.html">sparse</a>, users can manipulate the connection density of the synapse group after creation. Otherwise, it is not an option to edit the connection manager post-creation.
