<p>Simbrain allows considerable flexibility in designing a network. Networks of any topology can be designed, and each node can be customized to operate in a specific way. Network editing in Simbrain is modeled on a familiar &quot;draw&quot; interface which involves creating screen elements, copying, and pasting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Creating nodes</strong>. </em>Nodes are created by pressing &quot;N&quot; or by pressing the <img src="../../../Pics/New.gif" width="18" height="18"> button in the toolbar. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Connecting nodes</strong>: </em>To create connections <a href="selectingitems.html">select</a> one or more &quot;source&quot; nodes, then point the cursor at a target node, and either: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1) Hold down the &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;option&quot; keys simultaneously and left-click, or <br>
      (2) Right-click and select &quot;connect nodes&quot; from the <a href="../commands/popupmenu.html">pop-up menu</a>. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To quickly connect one group of neurons to another, select all the source neurons, and while holding down &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;option&quot; left-click on the target neurons one by one. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Selecting nodes.</strong> </em>Selecting neurons and nodes is important. This basically works the way most computer drawing programs work. You use the left-click button to &quot;lasso&quot; screen items. Once some items are selected, you can hold down the shift key to add more items to your selection. Keyboard commands can also be used: &quot;W&quot; selects weights only, &quot;N&quot; selects nodes only, &quot;A&quot; selects all screen elements. For more click <a href="selectingitems.html">here</a>. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Moving nodes</strong>. </em>Simply left click and drag the selected items, as you would a window or any other screen item on a modern operating system. For fine tuning, users can also use the arrow keys (with Shift held down) to &quot;nudge&quot; selected items. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Copy, Cut and paste</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Similar to other programs which have these features. Select items, use a menu or keyboard command to copy or cut, then use a menu or keyboard command to paste. For details click <a href="copypaste.html">here</a>. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Setting properties of nodes</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Select the neurons or weights you want to change and double-click on of the selected items. You can also use right-click and the <a href="../commands/popupmenu.html">popup</a> menu or the <a href="../commands/menu.html#NetworkMenu">network menu</a>. If you select both weights and neurons, which preference dialog comes up depends on which kind of item you click on. For more on setting node and weight properties click <a href="../prefs/nodeprefs.html">here</a>. </p>
