<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Setting a single synapse</span>: double click on a synapse or right click on it and select <span class="command">set properties</span>. Since synapses are relatively small, you can either zoom in or lasso the synapse of interest and select <span class="command">Network &gt; Set Properties.</span> </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Setting multiple synapses </span>: select more than one synapse, and either double click on one of the synapse, or select <span class="command">set properties</span> from the popup or network menu. A multiple synapse dialog box will appear. If the selected neurons are of different types, only the common properties appear. Otherwise all properties appear. Consistent properties are shown, inconsistent properties are marked by a null string: &quot;. . .&quot; Changes you make will apply to all selected synapses. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Editing xml files</span>: You can also edit synapse properties by directly editing the xml files, which have a fairly straightforward</p>

<p class="heading">Common Synapse Properties </p>
<p>These are properties common to all synapses, regardless of type. All of them have some reflection in the graphical interface, and some of them only matter to the interface (e.g. increment). For some synapse upper bound and lower bound does not play any role, but does limit how larget the graphical representation of the synapse can be. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Strength</span>: how &quot;strong&quot; this synapse is. This is represented by the size of the weight. By default a blue weight represents an inhibitory synapse with value less than 0. A red weight represents an excitatory synapse with value of 0 or greater. These colors and the size ranges can be set in <a href="network_prefs.html">network preferences</a>. Strength can be set by the up and down arrows and can be randoamized. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Increment</span>: this sets the amount that a synapse is incremented when it is manually adjusted. For example, if increment is set to .1, then each time the up arrow is pressed the synapse will increase its activation by .1. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2"><a name="upperbound"></a>Upper Bound </span>: This field plays different roles depending on the type of the synapse (documented accordingly) but in general it determines the maximum strength of a weight. It also determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on. This and lower bound determine the bounds of randomization.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2"><a name="lowerbound"></a>Lower Bound </span>: This field plays different roles depending on the type of the synapse (documented accordingly) but in general it determines the maximum strength of a weight. It also determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on. This and lower bound determine the bounds of randomization.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Delay</span>: A positive integer, which delays how many iterations or time-steps must occur before the pre-synaptic signal (the activation of the source neuron) is delivered. </p>
