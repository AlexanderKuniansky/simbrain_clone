        <h1>Weight Matrix Viewer</h1>
        <p>The weight matrix viewer allows weights connecting two sets of neurons to be viewed in a tabular format.  They can be used either for <a href="../Network.html#loose">loose neurons</a> or within <a href="groups/SynapseGroup.html">synapse groups</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="heading">Basics</span></p>

        <p>One can manipulate the strength of connections through the weight matrix viewer. Clicking on a cell allows one to manipulate the synaptic strength of the connection represented by the cell. One can also randomize the values in the matrix, set values from a .csv file or save values to a .csv file (see toolbar below)</p>

        <p><span class="heading">Loose Neurons</span> </p>

        <p style="float:right; margin: 30px;"><img width="500px;" src="../../Images/weightmatrixviewer.png"></p>

        <p>To view the synapses connecting two sets of loose neurons set <a href="connections.html#sourceTarget">source and target neurons</a> and then select  <span class="command">Show Weight Matrix</span> from the edit menu or by right clicking on any of the relevant neurons. Cells in the table correspond to connections between source (red) neurons as rows and target (green) neurons as columns. Values in these cells represent the strength of connections.  Non-existent connections are represented by gray boxes (see the image below).
        </p>

        <p><span class="heading">Within Synapse Groups</span></p>

        <p>In this context the matrix represents the weights of a <a href="groups/SynapseGroup.html">synapse group</a>, which connects a source and target neuron group.  Cells in the table correspond to connections between neurons in the source neuron group (rows) and target neuron group (column). Values in these cells represent the strength of connections.</p>

        <p>Note: Currently the weight matrix viewer is disabled for synapse groups with more than 10,000 synapses. This is due to the fact that a table of that size would be unnavigable, and of dubious use. At that size individual synapses are much less important. This is also to prevent users from accidentally attempting to view <i>extremely</i> large tables (much greater than 10,000 entries), which can cause the JVM to run out of memory.</p>

            <p><img src="../../Images/Rand.png" height="18"><span class="heading2"> Randomize: </span> Pressing the Random button will uniformly randomize the strength of all connections represented in the weight matrix viewer between two numbers (default (1,-1))

            <p><img src="../../Images/Open.png" height="18"><span class="heading2"> Open: </span> Pressing the Open button allows one to open a .csv file and set the values of the connections represented by the viewer to the values specified in the file.  The .csv being loaded must have the same dimensions as the weight matrix of the synapse group.
