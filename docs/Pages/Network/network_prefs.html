    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Color:</span> allows the user to change the color of the various components within the network frame. The colors that can be changed are: Background, Line, Hot node, Cool node, Excitatory weight, Inhibitory weight, Lasso,  Selection and Spiking. The current color selection is indicated by the color box located between the combo box and the &quot;Set&quot; button. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="heading2">Background color</span>: is the color of the network background.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Cool node color:</span> is the color of a neuron that has an activation level less than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Excitatory weight color:</span> is the color of the synapse that has a strength  greater than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Hot node color:</span> is the color of a neuron that has an activation level greater than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Inhibitory weight color:</span> is the color of the synapse that has a strength  less than zero.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Lasso color:</span> is the color of the line that appears when dragging the mouse to select neurons and weights. </p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Line color:</span> is the color of the lines that connect neurons.</p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Selection color:</span> is the color of the box that surrounds items that have been selected. </p>
        <p><span class="heading2">Spiking color:</span> is the color of a neuron's outline (and outgoing synapse lines) when it spikes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Weight size max/min:</span> sets the maximum and minimum size a weight can be. This option only changes the graphical size of the weight and has no bering on how the weight behaves.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="heading">Logic</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Round off neuron values:</span> if selected will round neuron values as per the precision set by the user.</p>
      <p><span class="heading2">Precision of round-off:</span> determines to what precision neuron values will be rounded off. Option is only available when  &quot;Round off neuron values&quot; is enabled. </p>

    <p align="left"><span class="heading">Misc.</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Nudge amount:</span> is the amount of indent to be used when indenting network files. This option is only valid when &quot;Indent network files&quot; is selected. </p>
