  <h1>Subnetworks</h1>
  </p>
<p>Networks made at the top-level out of neurons and synapses always behave the same: the program goes through the list of neurons, updates them according to their rules, and then goes through the synapse and updates them according to their rules.</p>
<p>The network also maintains a third list: a list of &quot;subnetworks&quot;, which are networks inside the network which behave differently than the top level network. Subnetworks are used when special rules are required that go beyond what is available locally to the node and connection objects, so that the update method above won't work. For example, some networks must have their nodes updated in a special order. </p>
<p>TODO: INSERT PICTURE </p>
<p>Subnetworks are marked off by a line surrounding them and a tab in the upper left corner. That tab is your interface with the subnetwork via the GUI. </p>
<p>Connections can exist between any two nodes, at whatever level of the subnetwork hierarchy. Subnetworks (networks within networks) are themselves network objects, with lists of neurons and nodes, and perhaps additional subnetworks. If a subnetwork itself has subnetworks, those are not shown as such in the GUI. </p>
