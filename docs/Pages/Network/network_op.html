  <p><h1>Network Operation</h1>
  <p>Each time the network panel is iterated the following occurs:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> 1. Any <a href="couplings.html">input nodes</a> are updated based on <a href="couplings.html">sensory couplings</a>. <br>
      2. The high level <a href="network/standardnetwork.html">standard network</a> is updated. This updates all  <a href="neuron.html">neurons</a>, <a href="synapse.html">synapses</a>, and <a href="subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a>. Their colors and sizes are updated accordingly.<br>
      3. State information is sent to the <a href="../Gauge.html">gauges</a>.<br>
      4. Signals are sent to <a href="../World.html">worlds</a> via <a href="couplings.html">motor couplings</a>. </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The neural network is essentially a graph, a collection of nodes connected by vertices (the vertices are neurons and the connections are synapses). Each node and vertex is an object. The whole network has three lists: a list of nodes, a list of connections, and a list of networks (&quot;subnetworks&quot;). The connections have references to the source and target nodes they connect. When a network is updated the program goes through the list of neurons and calls an update function internal to each one, and similarly with the list of synapses. Buffers are used so that the whole network can be updated synchronously. </p>
