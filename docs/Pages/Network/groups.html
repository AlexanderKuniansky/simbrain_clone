  <p></p><h1>Groups</h1><blockquote>
  <p>These
are&nbsp; logical groupings of neurons and / or synapses. &nbsp; There
are many reasons to collection neurons and synpases together. For
example, it can be useful to move, randomize, or other permute or edit
of a sub-population of synapses, that would otherwise be hard to access
and modify as a units</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most important groups are <a href="subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a>, which are discussed separately.<br>
  </p>
  <p>TODO: Neuron group, synpase group.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Subnetworks are distinguished by being surrounded by a gray line,
with
a special tab, often in the upper left-hand corner. is the your
interface with the subnetwork and its properties.&nbsp; If you right
click on the tab, various actions appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here is an example of a group, a backprop network.&nbsp; Note that it
is a group of groups: it includes as sub-groups 3 neuron groups, and 2
synapse groups.&nbsp; Each group has a yellow interaction tab.<br>

  <p>All groups have the following actions defined:<br>
  </p>
  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Remove group<br>
</span></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Delete the group and all its constituents.<br>
 </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Edit group name<br>
</span></p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>Edit the name of the group which appears in the interaction tab.<br>
 </p>
  </blockquote>


  <span class="heading2"></span>
  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Double Click</span></p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>If
you double-click on the subnetwork tab it calls up that network's
properties dialog. These properties depend on the subnetwork type. </p>
