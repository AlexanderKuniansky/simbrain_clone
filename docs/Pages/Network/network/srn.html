        <h1>Simple Recurrent Network</h1>

        <p>An SRN or Simple Recurrent Network (or Elman Network) is a kind of recurrent network. According to <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/pdphandbook/handbookch8.html">this site</a>: "The Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) was conceived and first used by Jeff Elman, and was first published in a paper entitled Finding structure in time (Elman, 1990). The paper was ground-breaking for many cognitive scientists and psycholinguists, since it was the first to completely break away from a prior commitment to specific linguistic units (e.g. phonemes or words), and to explore the vision that these units might be emergent consequences of a learning process operating over the latent structure in the speech stream. Elman had actually implemented an earlier model in which the input and output of the network was a very low-level spectrogram-like representation, trained using a spectral information extracted from a recording of his own voice saying 'This is the voice of the neural network'. We will not discuss the details of this network, except to note that it learned to produce this utterence after repeated training, and contained no explicit feature, phoneme, syllable, morpheme, or word-level units.""
