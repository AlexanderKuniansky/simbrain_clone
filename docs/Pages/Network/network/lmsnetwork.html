<h1>LMS Network</h1>
<p>The LMS Network is a two layer feed-forward network that implements
the standard Least Mean Squares rule for learning.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The
LMS rule is a form of supervised learning, which means that the user
must supply desired output values for each of a list of input
values.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The LMS
rule works as follows. The change in a weight is equal to the product
of a learning rate &#949;, the pre-synaptic source activation, and the
difference between the post-synaptic activation <em>a<sub>j</sub></em>
and a desired activation <em>t<sub>j</sub></em>. The error is the
difference between the desired and actual activation of the target
neuron.</p>
<p><img src="../equations/LMSRule.png" height="54" width="203"></p>
<p>Repeated application of this rule mimizes reduces mean squared error
on a set of training data. </p>
<p>This
rule is also known as the "Widrow-Hoff" rule, and the "Delta Rule."
Networks that use these rules are sometimes called "adalines" or
"madalines" (for the multilayer case, which these networks do not
currently implement). They are descendents of an early form of network
studied by Rosenblatt called a "perceptron."</p>
<p class="heading">Initialization</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since
these are two layer networks, they are initialized with a set number of
input and output units. The resulting layer will be two layers of the
specified number of neurons with feed-forward connections.<br>

<p class="heading">Training</p>

<blockquote>
Training a network involves specifying input data, target data, and
then running the algorithm.&nbsp; This process is covered <a href="../supervisedLearning.html">here</a>.
</blockquote>
<p class="heading">Parameters</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Learning Rate: </span>Learning rate is
denoted by &#949;. This parameter determines how quickly synapses change. </p>
