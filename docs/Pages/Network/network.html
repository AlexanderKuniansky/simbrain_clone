A set of values is sent to the <a href="inoutnodes.html">input nodes</a> of    the network based on the position of the creature in the <a href="../OdorWorld.html">world</a>.    (Or, if <a href="networldbutton.html">network-world interaction</a> is turned    off, one can <a href="manualadjust.html">manually adjust</a> the input nodes) </p>  <p> 2. The network is updated by going through the nodes and updating each    one ( As the nodes are being updated the new states are stored in a buffer    until all nodes are updated. Thus, it does not matter which order the nodes    are updated. ) The node currently being updated can be thought of as a &quot;target&quot; node;    the nodes which connect to it can be thought of as &quot;source nodes.&quot; Each    target node is updated as follows: </p>  <blockquote>    <p> 2.1 The signals being sent to it are determined. These signals are provided      by the output functions of source nodes. Output functions produce an output      signal based on the activation level of a node. There are a variety of      output functions available to each node. which are documented in the node- <a href="nodeprefs.html">preferences</a> dialog      box. The simplest output function is the identity function, which simply      outputs the activation level as is. Another common output function is a      threshold function, in which case a node will only produce an output, if      its activation is above some specified level. <em> Note </em> : Output      signals are not visible in the GUI; only activation levels and weight strengths      are visible. </p>    <p> 2.2 That node's activation function is called. This function updates      the activation level of a target node based on signals arriving from source      nodes, and the weights connecting source nodes to the target node. Again      there are a variety of activation functions available. A common activation      function is a linear function which forms a weighted sum from incoming      signals and weight values. Documentation on each activation function can      be found directly in the node- <a href="nodeprefs.html">preferences</a> dialog      box. The activation of a node is visible in the GUI as color and it is      printed as text. Activation values are also sent to the <a href="../Gauge.html">gauges</a> (      The distinction between output and activation functions will be eliminated      in the next release, as the neural network component is redesigned.) </p>  </blockquote>  <p> 3. Each weight's update function is called. As with nodes, the order in    which these functions are called does not matter. Documentation on each learning    function can be found directly in the weight-preferences dialog box . </p>  <p> 4. Express <a href="inoutnodes.html">outputs</a> as movement of the creature    in the <a href="../OdorWorld.html">world</a>.</p></blockquote></body></html>
