<p class="heading">Comparison with other free neural network packages: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">Genesis</a>, <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/">Neuron</a><br>
  Genesis and Neuron are geared towards modeling biophysically realistic neurons. The emphasis is on analysis of single neurons or small groups of neurons. 
<p><a href="http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu/">SNNAP<br>
</a>SNNAP is intermediate between Genesis and Neuron on the one hand and Simbrain on the other, providing tools for simulating spiking neurons using &quot;mathematical descriptions of ion currents and intracellular second messengers and ions.&quot; Simbrain does have some spiking neurons but they are early in development.
<p><a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/%7Ecogs2010/cmc/index.html">BrainWave<br>
</a>BrainWave is similar to simbrain, though its interface design is somewhat different. Built around a nifty on-line textbook. 
<p><a href="http://askja.bu.edu/catacomb/index.html">Catacomb</a><br>
  Catacomb is a comprehensive, open-source, java-based program for modeling realistic neural networks and virtual environments. It is similar to Simbrain in scope and intent.
<p><a href="http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/JavaNNS/welcome_e.html">JNNS</a>, <a href="http://www.joone.org">Joone</a>, <a href="http://openai.sourceforge.net/">Open-AI<br>
  </a> JNNS (a java-interface to SNNS) is a powerful freeware java neural network which contains numerous learning algorithms and supported by a large user-base. SNNS is not, however, open-source. Joone is open-source, and its focus is on backpropagation and real-world applications of neural networks. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/Resources/PDP%2B%2B/PDP%2B%2B.html">PDP++</a> <br>
  Heir to the PDP simulation package that came with &quot;volume 3&quot; of the original PDP volumes. Not open source.</p>
