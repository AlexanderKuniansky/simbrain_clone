  <h1>DataWorld</h1>
  <p>Data Worlds are essentially spreadsheets which can be used to send data to and received data from a network. Each row in a Data World corresponds to an input or output vector. Input and output neurons are coupled to particular columns. When the &quot;send&quot; button is pressed the values in the corresponding row are sent to all coupled input neurons. When output neurons are coupled to columns their activations are recorded in the corresponding column of the currently selected row of a Data World. Information can  be directly entered into the Data World spreadsheet, and can be imported from and exported to  *.csv files (which can be read by most spreadsheet programs, e.g. Excel). </p>

	<p><span class="heading2">Size</span>: Data World tables can have any number of Rows and Columns.</p>
	<p>Data in a Data World can be <span class="heading2">Randomized</span> with any bounds.</p>
	<p><span class="heading2">Iteration Mode:</span> Data Worlds can be set so that their current row changes as a coupled network iterates. In this way Data Worlds can be used automatically feed a sequence of inputs to a neural network. 
	<p> <span class="heading2">Send</span>
buttons push data from a Data World to coupled networks and iterate those networks.  This is useful when one wants to test the impact of different input vectors on a network.  Rather than selecting different rows then iterating the networks (a multi-step operation), the user just presses the send button of appropriate rows. </p>
