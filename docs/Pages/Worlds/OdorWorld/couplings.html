  <h1>Agents </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Odor worlds are coupled to networks via agents. Agents are shown (currently) as mice in OdorWorld windows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="../../../Images/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <p> Agents can move in various directions and sense objects in their surroundings. Note that agents can smell one another, but cannot smell themselves. </p>
  <p>The Odor World coupling menus are separated by agents, so that indvidual neurons can be coupled to specific creatures in the world. This allows, for example, for multiple creatures controlled by separate neural networks to interact.</p>
  <p class="heading">Motor commands </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">North, South,... </span>These move the creature in absolute directions. </p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Left, Right, Forward, Backward</span>. These move the creature relative to its current orientation. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Sensors</FONT></p>
  <P>The sensory menus are broken down according to the location of a &quot;whisker&quot; (even though these are suppsoed to be olfactory stimuli the whisker metaphor helps), and then a number which corresponds to a particular stimulus dimension. </P>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">Left, Right, Center</span>: The Location of the sensor on the agent. These can be thought of as left and right whiskers (whose properties can be set in the <a href="entitydialog.html#Agent">agent dialog</a>), and a central nose.</p>
    <p><span class="heading2">1,2,3...</span>: The numbers correspond to indices of sensory receptors. The value associated with a given index depends on what values are associated with it in different objects (where those values are set in the <a href="entitydialog.html">entitity dialog</a>). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Manually moving agents </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Agents and objects can be dragged directly. Agents can also be used using keyboard commands.  Click on the agent you wish to move. This &quot;selects&quot; the agent, though there is currently no indication that the agent has been selected in the GUI. The selected agent can now be moved forward, reverse, left and right by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard.</p>
