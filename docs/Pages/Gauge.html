	<h1>Gauge</h1>
	<p>One of the main methods for studying the activity of the network component in Simbrain is by using the gauge component. Each gauge is an instance of a program called <A HREF="http://hisee.sourceforge.net">HiSee</A>. HiSee is a high dimensional visualizer. Hisee can take the collection of states which are visited by a neural net and project them down into two dimensions so that many of their geometric and topological properties are preserved. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="heading">What the Dots Represent </p>
	<p>Each &quot;dot&quot; in the gauge represents a state of the network. When a gauge is first opened, there are no dots, since no state information has been sent to the gauge yet. With each update of the network, state information is sent to that gauge which displays it as a dot. The set of dots that appear in the gauge window represent the set of states that have been visited since that gauge was added. This gives us a kind of visual history of this network's past behavior. As the network is updated the user can watch new dots appear as new states arise. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<P align="left">The gauge below represents the states that have occurred in a network with 20 neurons. Each blue dot corresponds to one of those states. The red dot represents the current state. Points that are close to each other in the gauge correspond to patterns of activity that are similar. </P>
	<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
	<P align="left"><FONT size="5"> <img src="../Images/Gauges.gif" width="233" height="250"></FONT></P>
	<p>By default gauges represent the total activity across all the nodes of a network (when they are created by pressing a network's gauge button) though they can be set to represent any subset of a network's nodes or weights.</p>
	<p>There are two colors of dots in the network, the color of the &quot;hot point&quot; and the other dots. These colors can be set in the <a href="preferences.html">preference dialog.</a> </p>
	<blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Hot Point</span>: The current state of the network.</p>
      <p><span class="heading2">Other Points:</span> Past states of the network. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="heading">Pan and Zoom</span> </p>
    <p>The HiSee display is currently 2-dimensional. It is based on the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/piccolo/">Piccolo</a> zoomable user interface (ZUI), which allows users to pan and zoom and graphical data. When <a href="menu.html">autoscale</a> in the preference menu is turned off, you can pan the visible data by left-dragging (dragging the mouse while holding the left-mouse button down), and you can zoom in or out on data by right-dragging (dragging the mouse while holding the right button down). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="heading">Clicking on points</span></p>
    <p>You can also linger over data points to reveal which high-dimensional points they correspond to (via tooltips). </p>
