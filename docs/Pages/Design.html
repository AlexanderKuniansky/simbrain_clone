  <p class="heading">Simbrain design goals</p>
  <p>The overarching motivation of Simbrain is to make neural networks available to as wide an audience as possible. The basic idea is that neural networks are, fundamentally, easy to understand. They involve passing of information between simple units. By using a familiar graphical interface to display this, the hope is that network principles can be understood whether or not the user has background in mathematics and computer programming (which are standard prerequisites to the study of neural networks). On the other hand, it is also hoped that having such an intuitive tool will facilitate research by more advanced users who can use the tool to prototype network designs (for later high performance implementation), and to test network ideas in ecologically realistic environments. For example, a learning rule which works in a few scripted tests should also work when embedded in a creature randomly interacting with other creatures in a virtual environment </p>
  <p>If, using Simbrain, a 14 year old junior high school student discovers a novel network architecture, then the basic vision of Simbrain will have been realized. </p>
  <p>Some more specific goals are as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>User can immediately begin experimenting with neural networks.</li>
    <li>Easy-to-use, visual GUI which draws on familiar interface elements. </li>
    <li>Provide an educational tool for learning about neural networks through direct experimentation and visual representation. </li>
    <li>Ability to study sensorimotor integration by embedding the network in a virtual world.</li>
    <li>Ability to rapidly prototype neural networks of any topology. </li>
    <li>Ability to view the topological structure of the state-space of a neural network in real-time, and thereby study its representational capacities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="heading">What Simbrain is <em>not</em>: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>An engineering tool or a package for physiologically realistic modeling. In these cases, other programs are better suited; see below. </li>
    <li>Currently not a suitable platform for large simulations involving hundreds or thousands of neurons. </li>
  </ul>
