<ul>
  <li>User can  immediately begin experimenting with neural networks.</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use, visual GUI which draws on familiar interface elements. </li>
  <li>Provide an educational tool for learning about neural networks through
    direct experimentation and visual representation. </li>
  <li>Ability to study sensorimotor
    integration by embedding the network in a virtual world.</li>
  <li>Ability to rapidly prototype neural networks of any topology. </li>
  <li>Ability to  view the topological structure of the state-space of a neural
    network in real-time, and thereby study its representational capacities.</li>
  <li>What Simbrain is <em>not</em>: An engineering tool or a package for physiologically
    realistic modeling. In these cases, other programs are better suited; see
    below. </li>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comparison with similar
      packages: </font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">Genesis</a>, <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/">Neuron</a><br>
  Genesis and Neuron are  geared towards modeling biophysically realistic neurons.
    The emphasis is on analysis of single neurons or small groups of
     neurons. Simbrain is more focused on analysis of networks of simplified
connectionist processing units.
<p><a href="http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/JavaNNS/welcome_e.html">JNNS</a>, <a href="http://www.joone.org">Joone</a>, <a href="http://openai.sourceforge.net/">Open-AI<br>
    </a>JNNS, Joone, and Open-AI are powerful applications which operate at the
    same network level as Simbrain. JNNS (a java-interface to SNNS) is the oldest
    and most powerful freeware java neural network, contains numerous learning
    algorithms and supported by a large user-base. SNNS  is not, however, open-source.
    Joone is open-source, and its focus is on backpropagation.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/Resources/PDP%2B%2B/PDP%2B%2B.html">PDP++</a> <br>
  Heir to the PDP simulation package that came with &quot;volume 3&quot; of the
  original PDP volumes. Not open source.</p>
  <p><a href="http://askja.bu.edu/catacomb/index.html">Catacomb</a><br>
Catacomb is a comprehensive, open-source, java-based program for modeling realistic
  neural networks and virtual environments. It is similar to Simbrain in scope
  and intent, though its emphasis is less on connectionism and more on integrate-and-fire
  units. Also, the &quot;feel&quot; of the interface is different. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/%7Ebard/xpp/xpp.html">XPPAUT</a><br>
  Dynamical systems modeling tool. Useful for studying dynamical systems. XPPAUT
    has been used to study the dynamical properties of small groups of neurons,
    e.g. the Wilson-Cowan oscillator.</p>
