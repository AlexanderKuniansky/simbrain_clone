<p>As mentioned above, the gauges themselves are instances of HiSee,which is separately documented <a href="http://hisee.sourceforge.net/docs/HiseeDocs.html">here</a>. Some basic commands one is likely to use in the Simbrain setting are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Compare projections</strong></em>. Comparing how a pattern of dots (a history of states that have occurred in the relevant network subspace) looks under different projections by using the HiSee projection drop-down menu. When selecting &quot;Sammon&quot; be sure to press the play button to iterate the Sammon algorithm. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Save data</strong></em>. Using the File menu, save the high-dimensional data. It will automatically be saved in the simulations/gauge directory. Note that you will have to re-load this later (Simbrain simulation files don't currently save Gauge data). This is useful if you spend a long time acquiring some neural network data and want to save it for a demonstration or for analysis later.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Turning each gauge on and off.</strong> </em>The <img src="../../../Pics/GaugeOn.gif" width="18" height="18"> button on each gauge (not to be confused with the similar looking <img src="../../../Pics/Gauge.gif" width="18" height="18">button in the network component) controls whether that component is accepting data or not. Thus if a user has five gauges open, and wants to stop two of them from receiving new data, he or she must turn those gauge's on-off button's to off. Note that as the network is run it will still cause the current state to show up as a red dot, even if it is turned off to new data. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Fast addition of new datapoints</strong></em>. In each gauge's preference menu, under general preferences, one can select alternate methods for adding new datapoints. Nearest-neighbor subspace is suggested. These can be useful when many datapoints have accrued and the standard addition methods are slowing down. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Setting tolerance for new datapoints</strong></em>. New points are only added to a gauge if they are considered to truly be new. This is determined by testing whether they are within a specified distance of any old points. If thy are, they are not added. This distance can be set in the preferences menu under &quot;new point resolution.&quot;</p>
