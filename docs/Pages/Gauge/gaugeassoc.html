<p><h1>Associating Gauges</h1></p>
  <P>One can think of the total state space of a network as the set of all possible combinations of activations and strengths. Each gauge can be associated with a subspace of this total state space. Associating gauges with network subspaces is a two part process. First, a gauge must be added. Second, that gauge must be associated with a specific subspace.
  </P>

<span class="heading">Adding a Gauge Window</span>
<blockquote>
  <P>There are three ways to add a gauge window. Users can either click on the <em>Gauge</em> button, <img src="../../Images/Gauge.gif">, on the tool bar of the network component, select "Add Gauge" from the network menu within the network frame, or select &quot;New Gauge&quot; from the workspace menu. Each gauge window is assigned a name in the order in which it is added <EM> e.g. </EM> Gauge 1, Gauge 2, etc.</em>      
  </P>
</blockquote>
<span class="heading">Selecting a Subspace</span>
<blockquote>
  <P>By default a gauge represents the &quot;activation subspace&quot; of the network, which corresponds to the set of possible patterns of activity across its nodes. Hence, a 40-node network is associated, by default, with a 40-dimensional activation space. A 6-node network is associated with a 6-dimensional activation space. However, the user can associate any arbitrary subspace of the total state space of the network with a gauge.

  <P>To do so, one must first select what is to be visualized, then right-click, highlight <em>Set Gauges</em>, and specify the desired gauge. For example, suppose one would like <em>Gauge 1</em> to visualize the input row of this neural network. One would first select the input row as shown, right-click, highlight Set Gauge, and then select <em>Gauge 1</em>.</P>
