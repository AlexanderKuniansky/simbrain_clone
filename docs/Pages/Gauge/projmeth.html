      <td>HiSee projects data in two ways: (1) By applying algorithms to the entire dataset at a time, and (2) by dynamically adding new data points to a dataset based on its current configuration. The second method is described in <a href="Hisee/addpoints.html">adding points</a>. The first method, the main one, is described here. Note that between (1) and (2) and the ability to <a href="toolbars.html#Perturb">perturb</a> the data, quite a number of possibilities are open to the user. One can open an initial dataset using PCA, for example, then add new points using <a href="Hisee/addpoints.html">triangulation</a>, and finally use the resulting configuration of points as an initial condition for the Sammon mapping algorithm. </td>

If one has a list of data points with 40 components each, coordinate projection to two-dimensions simply ignores all but two of these components, which are then used to display the data in two-space. In HiSee users can select which two components are used and view the object from several view points. The program can also automatically select the two most variant dimensions to project along. </font></td>

      <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <strong> Principal Component Analysis (PCA): </strong> PCA builds on coordinate projection by making use of the "principal axes" of the dataset. The principal axes of an object are the directions in space about which the object is most balanced or evenly spaced. PCA selects the two principal axes along which the dataset is the most spread out and projects the data onto these two axes. </font>

      <td><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <strong> <a name="Sammon"></a>Sammon map: </strong>&nbsp; The Sammon map is an iterative technique for making interpoint distances in the low-dimensional projection as similar as possible to the interpoint distances in the high-dimensional object. Two points close together in the high-dimensional space should appear close together in the projection, while two points far apart in the high dimensional space should appear far apart in the visible projection. By minimizing an error function between the high and low dimensional sets of interpoint distances, the Sammon map does its best to preserve these distances in the projection. This iterative procedure can actually be watched in HiSee by loading a dataset and pressing the "play" button on the interface. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Note that when Sammon mapping is invoked points which overlap (what constitutes "overlap" can be specified in the Sammon <a href="Hisee/pref.html">preferences</a>) are perturbed, since overlapping points blow up the algorithm. </font></p></td>
