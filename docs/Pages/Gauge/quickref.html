  <div id="content">
  <p>Some basic commands one is likely to use in the Simbrain setting are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="heading">Compare projections.</span> </p>
<p>Comparing how a pattern of dots (a history of states that have occurred in the relevant network subspace) looks under different projections by using the HiSee projection drop-down menu. When selecting &quot;Sammon&quot; be sure to press the play button to iterate the Sammon algorithm. </p>
<p><span class="heading">Save data. </span></p>
<p>Using the File menu, save the high-dimensional data. It will automatically be saved in the simulations/gauge directory. Note that you will have to re-load this later (Simbrain simulation files don't currently save Gauge data). This is useful if you spend a long time acquiring some neural network data and want to save it for a demonstration or for analysis later.</p>
<p class="heading">Turning each gauge on and off. </p>
<p>The on / off <img src="../../Images/GaugeOn.gif" width="18" height="18"> button on each gauge controls whether that component is accepting data or not. Thus if a user has five gauges open, and wants to stop two of them from receiving new data, he or she must turn those gauge's on-off button's to off. Note that as the network is run it will still cause the current state to show up as a red dot, even if it is turned off to new data. </p>
<p class="heading">Setting tolerance for new datapoints. </p>
<p>New points are only added to a gauge if they are considered to truly be new. This is determined by testing whether they are within a specified distance of any old points. If thy are, they are not added. This distance can be set in the preferences menu under &quot;new point resolution.&quot;</p>
