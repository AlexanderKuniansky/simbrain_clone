Even if a new point is not exactly the same as some other point in the set, it may be "close enough" to be considered the same point. This field allows one to set a tolerance level for deciding whether two points are the same. If "2" is specified in this field, for example, then any new point within a radius of 2 of some existing point will not be added to the dataset. <em>Note</em>: Repeated points are allowed in the low-dimensional dataset; this field only applies to the high-dimensional data. </p>
          <p><em>Degree to which to perturb overlapping low-dimensional points</em> is the distance the program will move coincident low dimensional points before running the Sammon mapping algorithm. It must do this because overlapping low-dimensional points will cause the Sammon map to divide by zero (this is observed on-screen as the disappearance of all data or the contraction of data to a small point). </p>

Checking the <em>Color the data points</em> box colors the data points sequentially red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, red.

      <td><p>This dialog allows the user to set the step size used at each iteration by the Sammon map. The bigger the step size is the faster the projection algorithm will run but if the step size is too large the projected image will explode. One can generally experiment with different step sizes to get the right one. If iteration is progressing very slowly, one can just try something large, like 100, 300, or even 1000. If the dataset "explodes" (in which case everything in the display may contract to a point), press the randomize button to start over. </p>
          <p><strong>TIP: </strong>A step size of a little less than 1 is good for objects with about a dozen points while a step size in the hundreds is good for objects with hundreds of points. </p></td>
