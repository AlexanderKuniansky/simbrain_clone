<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">File format </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The data files used by HiSee contain lists of Cartesian coordinates for the position of the points in the data sets. The file format is known as "Comma Separated Values" or CSV, which is easily recognized by a wide-range of programs, including Microsoft Excel (though you may have to rename the files with the suffix ".csv"). The coordinates for single points are placed in a single line and they are separated by commas. The coordinates can be further separated by white space characters for easier reading by a user but this is not necessary. The coordinates for each point are placed on their own line in the file. For example here are the contents of a data file for an equilateral triangle in three dimensional space. </font></p>

<p><em>Default file: </em>Note that there is a default file, named "default.hi" in the Hisee/data directory, which is opened by default when the program launches, and projected using PCA. You can set this default file yourself simply by copying a file to the Hisee/data directory and renaming it "default.hi." </p>
<p><em>Three kinds of files:</em> files containing high-dimensional data, low-dimensional data, and combined files containing both kinds of data. Each kind of file is automatically saved with a suffix. When opening files, HiSee filters out all files except those with the relevant suffix. </p>

      <td width="624"><em>High-dimensional data</em>. ".hi" files contains the high-dimensional data to be studied. It is useful to save high dimensional data at the end of a session when the program is used in <a href="compmode.html">component mode</a> and new data is constantly being added. One can also add high-dimensional data to a dataset using the Add High Dimensional Data menu command. </td>

    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          <p>.low</p>
      </blockquote></td>
      <td><em>Low-dimensional data</em>. If a low dimensional dataset is opened, it must have the same number of datapoints as the high-dimensional dataset. It is sometimes useful to save several different low dimensional data files corresponding to different projections of the same data. It is also useful to save low-dimensional data to analyze a particular projection in more detail. </td>

      <td><em>Combined data</em>. Both high- and low-dimensional data; the "results" of a HiSee session. It is useful to save combined data when a high-dimensional dataset has taken a long time to project (using the Sammon map, for example), and the user wants to quickly open it later and begin where he or she left off. This data format is also useful for demonstrations. </td>

<p><em>Format for combined data files. </em><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">When saving the combined high and low dimensional data sets for a figure the file first begins with the high dimensional coordinates followed by a two blank lines and ending with the low dimensional coordinates. For example here are the contents of a data file for an equilateral triangle in three dimensional space which has been projected down to two dimensions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> <em>Comments: </em>Lines in a data file which begin with a "#" character are comments and are ignored by HiSee when reading the file. When HiSee creates a new data file it adds comments at the beginning of the file to record the name of the file. If the file contains combined high and low dimensional data HiSee adds the comment "Combined". For example </font></p>
