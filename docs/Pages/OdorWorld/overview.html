<P><FONT SIZE="3">The world component illustrates how neural nets can model the interaction of living organisms and their environment.. The creature in the world component  has the ability to move about in its world and to sense other objects which exist in that world. The sensory inputs produced by the world component can be received by the network component, which is the creature's information processing system (similar to an ensemble of neurons in an animal's nervous system). The network component, in turn, can produce outputs which are received by the world component to affect how the creature moves. The world component can also be seen as a user-friendly way to control the inputs and observe the outputs of a complex neural net in the network component of Simbrain. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3"> The world component is contained in it's own window that displays a rectangular region within which the creature can move about. The window contains icons which show the position of the creature and various objects.  The creature's and each object's  properties  can be set by the user in the <a href="worlddialog.html">world dialog box</a> and <a href="entitydialog.html">entity dialog box</a>.</FONT></P>
