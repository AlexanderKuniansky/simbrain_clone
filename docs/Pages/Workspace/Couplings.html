  </p><h1>Couplings</h1><br>
<p>A coupling is a link from an object in an attribute of an object in
another component (or the same component). A producer produces values
that are read by a consumer.</p>

<p>A list of all current couplings is shown in the Coupligns tab of the bottom information pane.</p>
<p>Most windows in Simbrain and workspace components, which are
wrappers around other objects, which are designed to exist in a
workspace.&nbsp; This mainly means attributes (for couplings).
Couplings tie these objects together via attributes. Attributes are the
"hooks" or "anchor points" that make up couplings. There are two kinds,
producing and consuming, which spit out and gobble up numbers
(currently; may be abstracted to more general datatypes).&nbsp; So, the
workspace can be thought of as a bunch of things that spit out numbers
and read them in. Making a simulation amounts to making number
spitter-outers and number-readers.&nbsp; For example, a simulation
might involve coupling neurons whose neurons are producers to a bar
chart whose bars are consumers (to see this, try bar chart test in the
script menu).</p>

<p><span class="heading"><a name="Attributes"></a>Attributes</span></p>
<p>An attribute is generic term for a producer or consumer, something that produces values or consumes values.</p>
<p>Examples are neuron activations, weight strengths, or bars on a bar chart, or sensor values for an agent in a virtual world.</p>
<p>They are the parts of a coupling, attachments points in the
simulation environment that can be connected together in the broader
simulation.</p>

<p><span class="heading">Coupling Creation</span><br>
</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to create couplings.<br>
</p>
<p>1. Use the coupling manager. To open this press the coupling manager
button on the Simbrain toolbar. This allows you to view every coupling
in the workspace. Here is a screenshot of the current coupling manager.
The current design is based on a mode where each component has its own
list of &#8220;bound couplings.&#8221; &nbsp;That will change, however. &nbsp;(We
should discuss this &#8230;)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Via context menus inside specific components. &nbsp;E.g. if
you right click on a neuron in a neural network a context menu will
point you to all other potential consuming and producing attributes in
the whole workspace. &nbsp;These context menus are built at the
workspace menu by polling all current workspacecomponents.<br>
</p>
<p>3. Via "coupling" commands in some menus. &nbsp;Quick and easy!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>4. Using a script.<span class="heading"><br>

<p><span class="heading">Confusions</span><br>
</p>
<p>Sometimes the terminology can be confusing. For example, in order
world, sensors seem to consume (info) and motors seem to produce
(motion). &nbsp;&nbsp;But in the context of the workspace it&#8217;s the
opposite. &nbsp;&nbsp;consumed info is produced or sent elsewhere...
produced motion is based on consumed info from elsewhere.]<br>
